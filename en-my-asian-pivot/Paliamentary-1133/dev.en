As the topics for trainings can vary, there are a series of questions organisations responsible for designing trainings could  consider to help identify the appropriate participants.
A project definition varies, as it covers a wide range of  operations from small projects to large complex programs.
Acknowledgement of supporting evidence and references
When writing a research brief it is important to write simply, clearly and concisely.
As a result, the ability of parliamentarians to fulfill their oversight roles is shaped by access to  legislative research that is knowledgeable, objective, factual and well balanced.
Phan Tee Eain (PTE) was established in 2009 to provide civic and voter education for the 2010 elections.
Moreover, depending on the cultural bias, readers may equate a generic term as referring to only men or  women: for example, the term “herders” can be automatically interpreted by many readers as referring to male herders.
Examples: laws governing the work of parliament, rules of procedure, strategic plan, reports on  previous assessments, reports from other projects supporting parliament, employment manuals for  parliamentary staff, press coverage of the work of parliament, etc.
To attract more female talent to the labor force, policies should promote a more flexible and family-friendly workplace that allows equitable and efficient distribution of time among household members;
It is the process of deciphering facts from  a body of evidence by systematically collating the data, ensuring its accuracy, conducting any statistical analyses, and translating the data into usable formats or units of analysis.
Works best in a semi-structured approach: allow for discus sion/conversation
Get a deadline. If you get them the information too late, the research will be useless
Parliamentary research support allows them to perform  their roles more effectively and efficiently.
The third resource is to think about specific people or organisations in Myanmar that may have the information a researcher is  looking for.

Furthermore, there are four levels of evaluating information gathered from  clients/stakeholders, including:
Alliance for Gender Inclusion in the Peace Process
Do you already have some information about the issue?
The first focused on building the capacity and practical knowledge of a  local Myanmar based think-tank, the Enlightened Myanmar Research Foundation (EMReF), on how to provide sustainable  support in the building of gender-sensitive parliamentary research capacity for sub-national parliaments.
Chapter 3: Design and Delivery of Parliamentary Research Trainings  
It is essential to analyse the gender differences and inequalities, and take them into consideration when designing and  implementing training sessions.
Logistics requirements
Provides access to health-specific indicators for 200 countries.
Asia Regional Integration Center—Myanmar
Independent evaluation is crucial for demonstrating how resources have been spent and what results have been achieved.
When designing a training, an organisation needs to consider the participants’ job profile or  description, especially the knowledge and skills needed for the position.
Qualitative vs. Quantitative Data
How they want to receive their briefing – email or hard copy.
How much time do participants have to learn new knowledge or skills?
Generic terms  can be used to present generic situations and gender specific terms to make visible men’s or women’s roles and perspectives.
It provides critical data and  analyses for key health themes, as well as direct access to the full database.

The primary purpose of a project evaluation is to make  improvements, to continue or upscale an initiative, to assess replicability in other settings, or to consider alternatives.
Within this context, it is evident the ability of parliamentarians to fulfill their responsibilities, requires access to  legislative research that is objective and factual, well balanced and presents all sides of the issue.
Individuals or an institution likely to be impacted by the project must take an active part in its design, decision making and implementation phases.
What subject matter experts will be needed? 
Some gender-specific questions that can be asked at this stage include:
Facilitator:
4. Training and Service Development for the Research Centre: extensive on-site training in research techniques and service  planning, and development of the specific suite of services the RC would offer
Bosnia and Herzegovina
2. Impact: is whether there has been a change towards the achievement of the overall objective(s) as a consequence of the achievement of the project purpose.
World Bank: Health, Nutrition, & Population Dashboards
Covers the full range of public policy. Parliamentary research services can act as ‘one-stop shops’ where parliamentarians can seek information on a wide range of topics.
It creates a  summation and/or synthesis of information derived from facts, statements, opinions, and documents and more importantly,  turns findings into conclusions about the results.
A training room to fit approximately 30 people
Such an evaluation refers to the final (long-term)  impact as well as to the (medium-term) effects at the outcome level.
For example, an introductory training  session may take longer to implement as the participants need to be introduced to the principles that build the foundation  of a given topic, as opposed to a more targeted training, which focuses specifically on the topic.
Interpretation is the process  of figuring out what the findings mean, making sense of the evidence gathered and its practical applications.
The outline, organized in a logical manner, sets out where in the brief the different issues will be  discussed.
According to an Inter Parliamentary Union  publication, Parliament and Democracy in the Twenty-First Century, parliamentary development experts agree  the following functions are considered key tasks undertaken  and expected of all parliaments:  
When designing a training, it should reflect;
A  good brief cannot be prepared without a clear understanding of the question.
The Parliamentary Centre has been  working in Myanmar since 2013 under a series of projects in support of the Union Parliament, sub-national legislatures and  the peace process.  
Additionally, each recommendation should clearly identify its target group and stipulate the recommended action and rationale.
Parliamentary research services not only help parliamentarians find the relevant information; they also help them make  sense of the information through analysis of its various dimensions and relating it the current work of Parliament.
Ex-ante evaluation is a forward-looking assessment of the likely future effects of new initiatives and support such as  policies, programmes and strategies.
Needs assessment experts, especially with conducting assessment of legislatures
All quotations, information and ideas should be clearly referenced.
Non-partisan research is important in helping parliamentarians, from both government and opposition, understand all sides of the debate and it  allows them to make policy decisions based on the same pool of information, which is balanced, objective and factual.
What equipment will be required on the training  dates?
Needs Assessment of the National Assembly was carried out with the participation of the MPs and staff, and shared  with the various stakeholders.
4. Goals-Based Evaluations: evaluate the extent to which programmes are meeting pre-determined goals or objectives.
From July 2017- June 2018, the Parliamentary Centre in partnership with the Enlightened Myanmar Research Foundation (EMReF),  implemented the project “Building Parliamentary Research Capacity: The case of Shan State’s Sub-National Parliament in  Myanmar” funded through a grant from Global Affairs Canada (GAC) and the International Development  Research Centre  (IDRC).

Tools for Needs Assessment
iii. how capacities such as financial and executive management, governance and country-based resources affect quality.
Mixed  method evaluations require the separate analysis of each element of evidence and a synthesis of all sources, in order to  examine patterns of convergence.
For every session determine the methodology that will be used.
4. Focus Groups: Another method of data collection is interviewing a carefully selected group of people, who participate in  a pre-determined, focused discussion led by an experienced evaluator.
Key factors to consider when conducting a Needs Assessment 
Build the research capacity of MPs and parliamentary staff
Working for parliament not the government. Parliamentarians need independent sources of information, if they are  to hold the government to account.
In-depth knowledge and experience in parliamentary research
The operational plan includes specific activities focused on the strengthening of parliamentary research capacity:
When preparing a research brief for parliamentarians, there are three critical points to keep in mind:
Researchers trained on how to analyze legislation for differential impact on gender.
List the sessions, time allocated to each session, who will be facilitating the session and objective.

What roles need to be filled on the project team? 
Whenever receiving an enquiry from a parliamentarian, be sure to ask them questions that not only help you understand  what is needed, but also makes them feel confident that you have understood their request.
Methodology
http://dhsprogram.com/Data/
learning (enhanced attitudes, perceptions or knowledge)
Parliamentarians operate in an environment where an instant response to a wide range of public policy issues is expected and time for reflection is limited.
It maintains a common data and  information repository with data from various sources on all sectors, countrywide, at the lowest administrative unit for  which it is available.

Understand the different research methodologies; 
Secondary data can take many  forms, but usually consists of documentary evidence that has direct relevance for the purposes of the evaluation.
