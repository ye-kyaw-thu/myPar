However, most international development organisations follow the  training management cycle when planning trainings.
Can be difficult to arrange;
In the publication, “Myanmar Parliament: Guide to Writing Parliamentary Research Briefings,” prepared by the UK House of  Commons under a UK Aid funded project, a checklist was developed that breaks down the editing and proof reading of a  research brief.
In order to ensure that all relevant perspectives in Parliament are reflected in the needs assessment, the Assessment Team  must be conscious of “capture” by key groups who would want to ensure that the assessment reflects their agenda.
Organisations design training sessions to fill specific needs, such as parliamentarians needing more research and information to  make sound policy decisions or parliamentary staff needing to improve their skills in certain facets of the job.

Academic research  conveys the notion of pure primary research to discover  the truth and fundamental relationships in society for the  purpose of advancing knowledge and/or understanding.
Non-Partisan Research 
In Myanmar, as in many other countries, there is a variety of think-tanks, capacity building organisations and networks  working on women’s rights and gender inclusion.
Serves political purposes 
Planning training sessions involves identifying training needs, recommending objectives and outcomes, and suggesting  how these can be achieved, based on the results of the needs assessment.
Introduction
Secondary information complements and supplements data  collected by primary methods, but does not replace collecting data from primary sources.
Before designing a training, it is important to understand  the project cycle, its different phases and the definition of  a project.
5. Thematic evaluations: In addition to project and outcome evaluations, senior managers of programme units may  choose to commission thematic evaluations to assess performance in areas that are critical to ensuring sustained  contribution to development results.
It provides an understanding of the following:
Following a transition period, the successful November 2015  elections saw a new National Assembly, intent to improve its capacity to carry out its functions more effectively and trans parently.

Introduction/Description
Keep in mind the value and necessity of broad-based participation by key stakeholders, especially parliamentarians  who are the direct clients of the parliamentary research products and services
Both intended and unintended impacts are reviewed.
Understand the structure of analytical reports.

Their design, method, and cost vary substantially depending on the type of question the evaluation is trying to answer.
It maintains a common data and information repository with data from various sources on all sectors, countrywide, at the lowest administrative unit for  which it is available.

The information gathered helps the organisation determine a  project baseline, while simultaneously identifying key topics and activities.
It is logical and direct, and cannot be misunderstood
Properly reference all information to the correct source.
Recognise and understand the core of the group (parliamentarians or parliamentary staff) whose needs are being  assessed

Sample Question
2Developing a research and knowledge  management manual for parliamentary  staff
There is no  set timing to conduct a needs assessment and as such, many assessments combine these two options.
Specific – clear-cut and to the point without leaving a lot of room for ambiguity
For example, some parliamentarians may value access to in-depth analysis of complex public policy issues, whereas  other may prefer timely access to succinct material to support their parliamentary work.
The organisation is also working on  developing the capacity to act as trainer for sub-national parliaments in various areas, including parliamentary research. 
Parliamentary Staff
Project Name: Supporting Democracy in Burkina Faso
The mission of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is to promote policies that will  improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.
WHEN
This is a quick and efficient means of collecting data, which can be  used in the initial stage of the assessment as well as in benchmarking the process;
A country’s lung cancer mortality rate for men far outstrips the corresponding rate for women because smoking is considered a marker of masculinity, while it is seen as unfeminine in women.”
A teenage boy dies in an accident because he is trying to live up to his peers’ expectations that young men should  be ‘bold’ risk-takers.
Define gender-sensitive parliamentary research;
Since 2012 it has  also been promoting gender equality among parliamentarians and political parties by strengthening the leadership capacity and skills of women candidates and elected women in Myanmar.
helps ensure existing (often limited) resources are directed towards developing and implementing prioritised and  realistic parliamentary research solutions;

It is worth noting that needs assessments of parliaments research capacities can be conducted by Parliaments themselves  (Self-assessments) or alternatively, by an external team of experts (External Assessments).

Implementing the research manual
However, in common practice, needs assessments follow  a three-step process:
It also helps identify key questions to be answered and key concepts or technical terms that will be defined. A  good outline ensures all important questions and/or concepts are covered.
Use Annexes. If there is information that a researcher may want to include, move it to an annex. This avoids making  the body of the briefing too long. For example, lists of data, large quotes and supplementary information all can be  annexed
Once the research brief has been written, it should always be reviewed by either a manager or a senior researcher.
The World Bank—Data Bank
Make sure to read the daily news. Members usually ask about topical issues, and therefore, every morning you should  listen or read the daily news
The starting point of a project is the existence of a  problem or gap affecting a certain group 
Different types of evaluations comprise project, programme, sectoral, thematic, policy and management evaluations.
EMeRF has focused on Performance Analysis of  Local Legislatures (2010-2015), and currently distributes data on local legislatures through the MyPILAR website (www. mypilar.org) and by issuing bi-weekly news bulletins on the work of state legislatures.
Their level of knowledge will increase from a Level 1 to a  Level 2 on a scale of 1 to 5, where I is minimal knowledge  and 5 is maximum knowledge

Frequently, lessons highlight strengths or weaknesses in preparation, design and implementation that affect  performance, outcome and impact.
In turn,  this means independence from line management.
Alternatively, parliamentarians, without a research service,  face the daunting task of identifying the relevant information needed on their own.
Popular uprisings in 2014 resulted in regime overthrow.
Remember, when developing objectives for the training session, they should be:
Once all the sources of information for the research brief have been identified, each source needs to be critically evaluated.
For example, a survey can be designed to gather more data on gender-sensitive parliamentary research capacities of a parliament.
This publication was carried out with the aid of a grant from Global Affairs Canada (GAC) and  International Development Research Centre (IDRC).
In addition to the wide range of global statistics, the  WDI provides convenient data extraction tools that allow data access in Microsoft Excel and other statistical packages.
External Actors
Additionally, as governments often change, the research staff does not, which means it can also serve as an avenue of institutional memory.

This may be helpful when collecting specific  in-depth thoughts and opinions on the quality and types of research products and services.
Using materials already in existence
Knowledge of the country and Parliament being assessed, and the specific working culture, professional contacts/relationships within the Parliament being assessed

Be limited to situations, time periods, persons, contexts and purposes for which the findings are applicable.
Included amongst these sources are  contacts within Government Departments, civil society organisations and think tanks.
In many cases, the ability of a parliamentarian to become knowledgeable about the range of possible issues and the quality of a parliamentarian’s response is vastly improved with the assistance of a parliamentary research service.

Data acquisition and information synthesis
Given that parliamentary researchers undertake mostly secondary research, identifying appropriate sources of information  is essential for the ability of the researchers to  incorporate a gender lens in their work.
