The median age for local leaders interviewed  in our study was fairly similar – 49 years for females and 52 years for males.
Myanmar’s subnational administrative structure is comprised of 14 states/regions, 74 districts,  330 townships, and 16,753 wards (urban) and village tracts (rural).
The Pyithu Hluttaw is designed to have 330 MPs that are elected by the people and 110 MPs  that are appointed by the military.
3. Women’s and men’s level of participation in Myanmar politics
Cultural norms and social attitudes have a powerful effect in shaping which types of people are able to become political leaders. However, these are not fully prescriptive, and some  individuals are actively challenging them. 
Politics is a way of changing people’s lives, and democracy is a way of making fair decisions  about people’s lives.
Comprehensive data is lacking,  but very few women are found in: key leadership positions within political parties (at central, township, or any other levels); leadership positions in the Tatmadaw, EAOs or militias; or as village/ward elders or 100 HHs. 
Women face greater time constraints than men to become parliamentarians, party  officials or local leaders.
For  most parties, the key body for candidate selection at the township level was the TEC itself.  
SAZ = Self-Administered Zone
Although most families are supportive of leaders’ political activities, when family members  do criticise leaders’ participation in politics this criticism can be shaped by the gendered  roles that males and females are expected to perform within the family.
This dynamic was summarised by one of our FGD participants:
Working Paper 3 will be  published in December 2020, and will present evidence from a large-scale survey on gender  differences in political attitudes and behaviour.
It is important to note that numerical representation in parliamentary bodies does not  automatically entail ‘substantive representation’, i.e. whether policy making and the style of  governance is responsive to the needs and preferences of different groups of people.
5. The role of political parties and other governance institutions in promoting or limiting gender equality in political participation
This  meeting of global leaders spurred an unprecedented push for gender equality in a number of areas.
For example, men in Myanmar are considerably more likely than women to drink alcohol and use drugs, and to be perceived as corrupt.
  Prioritisation of which parties and candidates to support should be influenced by both whether they have a realistic chance of winning parliamentary seats, and parties’ own  financial resources (giving preference to parties that do not have large financial resources already). 
Whereas, no female  interviewees mentioned family members objecting to them neglecting business/income generating activities, and no male interviewees mentioned being criticised by family members for neglecting housework or childcare. 
For example, a female W/VTA said that: “I was insulted by some people because they prefer to have a male ward  administrator. Therefore, there were big problems during the election.” (Female,  W/VTA, Mon State)
Specifically,the conference high lighted women’spersistent political under representation as a democratic problem as well as a hurdle for economic and human development.

We did not  observe any gender differences in the likelihood of candidates to experience harassment or abuse, but there do seem to have been differences in the type of harassment experienced, with women being more likely than men to face personal accusations. 
The benefit that participation has on participants’ well-being depends heavily on the quality of participation – if participants have the  opportunity to actively contribute to discussions and genuinely influence decision-making then their participation is likely to be welfare enhancing, but if ‘participation’ simply entails attending meetings  with no opportunity to influence decisions this is much less likely to be the case.
Indeed, if people are required to give up their time for activities such as attending meetings, but are unable to influence the decisions being made, ‘participation’ may even reduce their welfare.
Training classes for parties and candidates – and especially ethnic minority, religious  minority and female candidates – on how to respond to disinformation, online hate  and harassment during campaigns. 
However,  therearevariousotherpersonal characteristics that canaffectpeople’sopportunities toparticipate in politics, such as age, socio-economic status, ethnicity, religion and geographical location.
Nevertheless,  international financial institutions, UN agencies, and international and national NGOs also have roles as political actors in Myanmar.
The Tatmadaw is the other major force in Myanmar’s national politics, and is entirely led by  men, most of whom are also Bamar. 
Evidence from various countries and political contexts demonstrates that  male gatekeepers will tend not just to select men successors, but that they also tend to protect  the existing internal party culture and the existing practices.70 
Cultural norms make it harder for women to travel to remote areas and/or overnight
Establish clear rules on how people are selected to fill key party gatekeeper positions and to stand as parliamentary candidates. 
Introduce direct elections for the position of ward/village tract administrator, with  universal suffrage for all local residents aged 18 and above. 
Ensure that ideas and feedback from public meetings are properly incorporated into local  leaders’ decision-making. One practical way to do so could be to add a compulsory agenda  item for leaders’ meetings on weighing ideas and feedback from public meetings. 
Whereas, the local leaders interviewed for this study had  occupational backgrounds that were much more representative of the general population,  with 54% employed in agriculture, and many of the others working in other common sectors  of employment such as wholesale and retail trade, accommodation and food services, and  manufacturing.
4c) Background in politics or public lifန 
The rise in online abuse may  be exacerbated by restrictions on physical movement on parliamentary candidates and voters  as part of GoM’s COVID-19 containment efforts, that are likely to encourage all kinds of political-related activity to move online. 
Myanmar’s State/Region Hluttaws vary dramatically in size,  but all also reserve 25% (or slightly more) of seats for military appointees.
Therefore, improving the gender equality of participation in governance bodies should typically result  in policy-making decisions becoming more equitable, as these governance bodies become less biased  towards to the needs and preferences of male citizens.
Although large numbers of women attend ward, village tract and village level meetings, they  are less likely than men attendees to participate actively in discussions. 
USDP interviewees gave highly inconsistent descriptions of the respective roles of  township and central level party committees.

Gender and Political  Participation in Myanmar
However, for the 2020 election the SNLD, as well as the Chin National League for Democracy (CNLD), adopted a target of  having 30% female candidates.77
