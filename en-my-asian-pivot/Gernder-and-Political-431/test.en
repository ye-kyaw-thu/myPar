All district level  officials are unelected, as are most township level officials, including the most powerful leaders. Whereas, the community-level positions of W/VTA, 100 HH and 10 HH are all elected.
SNLD = Shan Nationalities League for Democracy
3. Women’s and men’s level of participation in Myanmar politics
No data has been published on the proportion of women and  men in the position of 100 HH and 10 HH.
All of the parliamentary candidates that described experiencing benefits to their life as a result of the political improvement were those that had been successful in the 2015 election – none of the nine unsuccessful candidates for this study  described their political involvement resulting in any improvements in their lives. 
Meanwhile, leadership is widely  associated with maleness in Myanmar, and women were more likely than men to mention  their leadership skills as relevant skills or abilities that helped them to get chosen as leaders.
E.g. males tend  to face criticism for neglecting their business/income generating activities, whereas  women tend to face criticism for neglecting their housework or not spending enough time  with their children (see Section 6 for further details).
GoM = Government of Myanmar
Myanmar’s 2008 Constitution guarantees a considerable political role for the Tatmadaw,  including: preserving at least 25% of seats in Myanmar’s parliaments for military appointees; the ministers of Home Affairs, Defence, and Border Affairs being appointed by the Tatmadaw rather than by the President; and the Tatmadaw having veto power over constitutional change. As well as its role in politics and as a security actor, the Tatmadaw also has a  considerable informal role in Myanmar’s economic governance.
There are also minimum age requirements for certain leadership  positions, and for example: Union ministers must have attained at least 40 years of age, Amyotha Hluttaw MPs at least 30 years of age, and Pyithu Hluttaw MPs and W/VTAs at least  25 years of age.
Although NLD’s vote may decline in 2020 relative to  2015, they are still expected to win a majority in the Union level hluttaws,82 and will also  probably win a majority in most State/Regions Hluttaws. 
TNP = Ta’Ang National Party
This highlights the importance in the Myanmar context of  understanding who parties recruit and how they recruit them, if we want to understand the different opportunities that women and men have to become MPs. 
CC = Central Committee
  If CEC and/or TEC selection processes are strongly influenced by certain individual party leaders, those leaders need to be convinced of the importance of promoting  gender equality within party structures, including on the CEC and in TECs. 
Parties should also introduce targets for women’s representation on their central  executive committees (CECs), central committees (CCs), and township executive  committees (TECs).

Women and men report approximately equal levels of trust in the president. 
3b) Women’s and men’s statistical representation in 4 Myanmar politics
In theory, the ‘standard process’ used by most parties in our study for nominating candidates  to the Pyithu and State/Region Hluttaws in the 2015 election was for the township level party  to arrange a candidate election process, after which the nominated candidates would be sent  to CC and CEC level for scrutiny and then approval/rejection. 
CBO = Community-Based Organisation
NLD = National League for Democracy
Studies from South Asia have found that making participation in local governance bodies  more gender equal can result in these bodies becoming more efficient and effective.
Family members’ involvement in community activities also seems to inspire and facilitate people to participate in leadership at community levels,  and female local leaders are much more likely than male local leaders to say that their family  member(s) had inspired them to engage in community affairs.
As Aung San made clear, politics is not just government activities, and  should not only be something performed by elites: “Politics means your everyday life … It is how you eat, sleep, work and live, with which politics is concerned.”
This EMReF synthesis report tries to explain why there is  currently so much gender inequality in political participation in Myanmar, and what can be done  to change that, including making progress towards these MSDP targets.
Further, previous research found that only three of the 91 parties that competed in  the 2015 election had a woman in any of the most senior positions within the party (e.g. leader, deputy-leader, or chairperson), and only one of these parties won any parliamentary  seats in that election – the NLD, which has Aung San Suu Kyi as chairperson.
However, previous research on  Myanmar suggests that differences between parties are more significant than candidates’ gender in determining whether financial costs are a major barrier for potential and actual candidates. 
However, impressionistic evidence from our  field work indicates that a large majority of 100 HHs are men. Men also appear to be the majority of 10 HHs, although women are much more frequently found in this position than as  W/VTAs or 100 HHs.
These  differences are referred to at some places in this report, and in Working Papers 1-3.
Our interview and  FGD data indicates that young women are particularly likely to be excluded from participation  in local decision making.
However, it is still extremely low by international standards – as of  25th September 2020, the IPU’s global database indicates that Myanmar ranks 167 out of 191  countries for the level of women’s representation in the national lower house.
FGD = Focus Group Discussions
However, impressionistic evidence suggests that there are very few female elders, but quite large  numbers of female CBO leaders. Committees at local level tend to be male dominated, although an exception to this are the committees created for the National Community Driven  Development Project(NCDDP), which have a quota mandating 50:50 female:male representation.
Internet use has risen further since 2015, and online harassment is  therefore likely to increase in the further in the 2020 elections. 
7. Conclusions 
Despite some limited moves towards decentralisation over the last decade, formal legal,  policy-making and budgetary powers in Myanmar remain highly centralised at the union level.
An extreme  example of this in the Myanmar context is Aung San Suu Kyi; it is extremely unlikely that she would have reached her eminent position in Myanmar politics if she were not the daughter of  Myanmar independence hero Aung San.
Whereas, there are  zero Muslim MPs in the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw or any of the State/Region Hluttaws, despite  Muslims making up more than 4% of Myanmar’s population.
If parties have township-level systematic processes that follow instructions issued by  the central party, which at least a large majority of townships consistently follow,  there is high potential to work with the central party to issue rules, guidelines or  targets for the township level. Such an approach is less likely to be effective absent such precedents. 
A small number of women have  occupied senior roles in certain EAOs, but senior positions in EAOs and militias also tend to be  very male dominated.
In some parts of Myanmar,  ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) play significant roles as service providers and governance actors, providing services such as education, health, justice, security, mining and forestry  management, land registration, and agricultural promotion.
Only 1 out of 23 W/VTAs did not  have prior experience in community leadership positions, whereas for more than half of 10  HHs and other community leaders, this was their first community leadership position.
ANP = Arakan National Party
