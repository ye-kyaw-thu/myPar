Since SIM 4  and across all the villages in the panel, labor costs have  increased significantly due to the outward migration boom  in recent years as well as the expansion of nonfarm jobs that  have reduced the available supply of labor.

Case Study 8: A Non-Tract Village Ignored by Their VTA 
As discussed above, climate change must be recognized by  all actors working in the Ayeyarwady Delta as perhaps the  most powerful force affecting livelihoods and social change.  
These changes have had negative effects on harvests and driven farmers to  leave some land fallow, change crops, and seek alternative or supplementary income sources.  
•  What are the main factors that affect, implicitly or explic itly, the current livelihood situation of villagers? 
The most striking economic difference  is in villagers’ indebtedness, where 80 percent of highly  affected villages face severe debt problems vis-à-vis 20 percent of the lightly affected ones. 
Further, fishers tend to have the most limited access to credit.

Moderately affected
Within the 50 percent of SIM villages where sum mer paddy is grown, the farmers who can afford to finance  the more expensive summer crop do so, though often only  on their highest quality (and least flood-prone) land.
Highly affected
This change was attributed to both their reduced status vis-à-vis the VTA and broader  political changes that have lessened local leaders’ ability to  instruct villagers to do things. 
This situation could not  be attributed to the cyclone alone; multiple other factors  were now influencing villages’ paths to recovery, with more  recent climatic shocks playing key roles.
In other words, the capacity of the survivors to  recover from a major disaster depended more on how many assets they had lost to the disaster than the number of lives  lost in the community. Consequently, SIM 4 used the fol lowing definitions, as assessed by villagers and researchers:

However, as Table 11 shows, beyond this linkage there does not appear to be a correlation between the degree of cyclone affectedness and the  condition of the fishing sector over the past five years.
Buying a home in town has a similar impact: in one case, for example, a farmer bought a house in town to provide his  children a place to live while at school, but when the village  flooded, the house offered a place for the entire family to  live while repairs were being made.

The introduction of this new focus area, encapsu lated within the ‘Recovery and Resilience’ analysis chapter,  sought to examine the longer term effects of Nargis on vil lages’ trajectories, identify where and how resilience has (or  has not) been improved, and understand lessons that could  be applied in future post-disaster contexts.  
Moreover, data  limitations notwithstanding, it is estimated that nearly one  in four of those who work in agriculture are landless despite  the region’s focus being on agriculture.  
Women suffered more  heavily from Nargis, accounting for 61 percent of the people  who died that night (with the number much higher in some  villages).32

In addition, returned female migrants have larger  roles in social affairs of the village.
For the 20 percent who have been unable to improve the  quality of their housing, it was generally attributed to at  least one of the following challenges: reliance on only one  income source, which meant a high ratio of dependent family  members, health shocks, a lack of education to get a better  job, or social problems like alcohol or gambling addictions.

Some fishers choose to migrate, either sea sonally during the low fishing period or, for families with  multiple working adults, one person may migrate perma nently to Yangon or further afield.
Migration is an even more  effective tool to reduce livelihood exposure as it largely  removes a working adult’s income from the ebbs and flows  of the rural economy.

Relations within Village Groupings 
Households across the Delta rely on each other for assis tance on specific needs; households mostly continue to help  each other where they can.
22 Infrastructure quality is defined as follows: housing (“good”:  most houses are of a high quality, made of concrete, some with  two stories, all are in good condition; “fair”: most houses are  made of wood with zinc/tin roofing, most are in good condition;  “poor”: broken down, homes in need of repair, many are made  of bamboo walls and nipa palm roofs); schools (“good”: made  of concrete, well constructed to withstand storms, large enough  for the number of students to grow; “fair”: older building in need  of updating but fit to purpose and just large enough for current  students; “poor”: run-down building in need of repair, not large  enough for current student body; “missing”: no school building in  village); water/sanitation (“good”: easy access to ground water  and/or storage tanks and/or well-maintained water ponds; “fair”:  enough water ponds, no concerns over water shortages, access to  ground water via pump; “poor”: water ponds are in bad condition,  vulnerable to salt water intrusion and villagers have to buy water  during dry season; “missing”: not enough water ponds for village needs, individual households have to store own water); health (“good”: has an own functioning health center or is close to town  with access to a district hospital; “fair”: has health care staff in the  village but not well equipped beyond basic services for children  and pregnant women; “poor”: no permanent presence, but regular  visits by health care staff for natal care/child vaccinations; “miss ing”: no staff in village and rarely visited because of remoteness  and poor transport options, villagers have to travel to other village  for basic care, rely on traditional medicine).
It can be surmised that the sample villages would still be poor  today without Cyclone Nargis, but that they would be less in  debt and have more assets at their disposal, which would  enable them to take fuller advantage of the opportunities the country’s economic and political transformations are offering.

And yet, the SIM series has shed  unprecedented light on a recovery process from devastation  that has had as many twists and turns, and as many paths,  as the Ayeyarwady Delta itself.
For example, farm ing returns captured by SIM 3 suggested the sector was on  a positive trajectory, but by SIM 4, farmers were struggling  again.
Small farmers
This positive picture for prices is, however, tempered by two issues.
Recovery and Resilience 
The other group of reasons, accounting for 18 of  the local leader changes across the SIM panel, centered on  the dissatisfaction of the community and involved cases  where the village leader lost out to a competitor. 
Women are instead  more likely to engage with other types of credit adjacent programs, such as bookkeeping training or learning to set  up small tailoring shops with support from a village revolving fund.
However, larger landowners have also lost land over the past  decade, which has in turn reduced the disparity in farm sizes  within a given village.  
New equipment has allowed fishing boats to go  further afield, and better quality seed and market access  improved farmers’ returns per acre. 
12 
Support of the  ruling political party (the Union Solidarity and Development  Party at the time) was on occasion also a factor. 
At the same time, their ability and willing ness to respond to requests for help has declined.
Moderately affected
In fishing households, the act of setting and retrieving the  nets is normally done by the male head of household and/or  the eldest son.
Land consolidation has slowed, and for most  farmers, selling land is a last resort rather than  an economic opportunity 
Though there is  no formal process for 100 household head selection, as they  are perceived as assistants to the VTA when a new VTA is  elected, new 100 household heads often follow. 
Six villages across the SIM panel now have a female  10 household head, and despite the decline in regular influ ence of this position, the increase means that women now  have a more direct voice in local elections to select VTAs.  
Medium farmers
16 Discussions with the research team and analysis of the data sug gest that while the registration process may have caused some ten sions, for villages where all farmers have Land Use Certificates and  the issue of who owns what land has been largely settled, LUCs  serve to reduce uncertainty over ownership and have reduced  intra-village disputes over land. Nonetheless, it is worth noting  that LUCs have not solved long-standing disputes over land, par ticularly where land has been seized by parties outside the village,  especially government or government-linked companies. Such  instances, however, are uncommon across the SIM panel.
However, there have been negative social effects as well.

In the aftermath of Nargis, aid28 delivery saved lives and then  sought to rebuild lives. 
But the  region has changed irrevocably as a result of both Nargis  and Myanmar’s broader political and economic transition.

However,  fewer villages, especially those moderately affected, are in  debt traps and, among lightly and moderately affected villages, there is a clear increase in the number of households  who are able to regularly settle their outstanding loans.
The most important factors that affect a household’s ability  to recover faster in the immediate aftermath of a disaster  were identified as the survival of assets, local job oppor tunities, remittance income, ability to manage household  resources, aid, and the health and number of working fam ily members.

In the weeks following the storm international actors began  a wide-ranging humanitarian aid effort.
Unsurprisingly, the main difference across levels of affected ness is the level to which households could rely on existing  economic assets. 
At the same time, post-disaster aid helped not just to build  back, but to build back better, and thereby contribute to  some reduction in the area’s development deficit.

For infrastructure, the challenges of restarting livelihood activities due  to asset and manpower losses combined with high levels  of debt and a lack of confidence undercut the ability of  highly affected villages to improve infrastructure on their  own. 
Since before Nargis, there were two peak seasons for agri cultural labor: the monsoon planting and monsoon harvesting season.

Second, MADB limits credit disbursement  to 10 acres per farmer, and while in the years immediately  following registration large farmers could get around this  by registering land under multiple family members’ names,  MADB has begun cracking down on this practice and there fore making it much more expensive to borrow for input on  anything over 10 acres.

Simultaneously, however, inten sive investments in the fishing sector during the previous  year led to overfishing and a drastic reduction in output and  employment.

Moreover, villagers thus far had  had few opportunities to influence the aid effort, which had  led to the provision of some kinds of aid not adapted to local  needs.
The condition of village infrastructure and housing reflects  how the condition of villages has evolved since Nargis and  what the continuing effects of the disaster are.

As there is no longer  any officially designated role for the 100 household heads,  the VTA role has gradually taken over many of the duties  they previously had, such as issuing letters or bearing wit ness to agreements. 
Preparing for a future disaster can seem to lack clear ben efits, and programs on how to survive or withstand a storm  can seem immaterial to a farmer who is struggling to deal  with drought-induced pests.

For both  this and the LUC-based loans, the farmer is still able to work  his farmland, while also able to access finance, which is  used to pay for inputs, other farming costs and, sometimes,  their own consumption in advance of the harvest.

Second, there are the small-scale fishers who either work  independently or in small groups of family members or friends.
Resilience as a by-product 
Instead, they pay  village laborers to take their place, generally for a wage of  between K3,000 and K5,000 per day.

For example, since well before  Nargis, farming households would ask for labor sharing  help from other farmers when ploughing or planting their fields.

At  the same time, despite numerous village projects, an infrastructure deficit still exists across the panel villages.

Farmers began to lose land to moneylenders as they  failed to meet their debt payments.
At the time of SIM 5 research the household’s main businesses are the grocery shop and betel plantation.
Mostly the head of household  (who holds the debts) will leave, but the SIM 5 research  found numerous examples where whole families would run  to other parts of the Delta or to Yangon in an effort to flee  from their creditors.
The Enlightened Myanmar Research Foundation conducted  the field research and analysis for SIM 5, with technical  support from the World Bank and Andaman Research &  Advisory.

Further, having a village health  center is not determinative of ‘good’ access to health services, as many of the centers that do exist, as well as many  schools, are often of poor quality. 
SIM 5 has used the same definition for affectedness devel oped for the SIM 4 research.  
For most of these farm ers, diversifying either meant doing local casual labor jobs,  or seasonal migration to the township center or to Yangon.

Since SIM 4, there have been some improvements in com munities’ transportation infrastructure (Table 27). 
This clearly fits with the  findings in Chapter 2, which indicated that new livelihoods  in the villages were closely correlated with an improved economic context.

Socioeconomic conditions remained challenging and  were exacerbated by the wider economic environment.

Other communities which experienced high winds but are situated  away from waterways on higher elevations, build homes  with a larger footprint that are closer to the ground. 
Farmers were unable to afford adequate inputs and cultivated their land less intensively.

Diversification by the poor of their income through migra tion is a common phenomenon in post-disaster contexts.  
Roads have been improved,  but the lack of quality or inability to use them during the  monsoon means villagers are unable to rely on them.

First, given the challenges of finding  labor, increasing input costs, and highly variable returns,  the advantages of having large amounts of land (especially  if that land is far from the village or in a bad location) are less attractive.

On the whole, the  post-disaster needs of women often do not receive the atten tion they deserve.

Small farmers have been the least affected by debt increases of  any livelihood group, showing only a marginal increase over  the previous four years.
While power competition  does arise, for the most part the village leadership is able to  maintain a balance between the administrative roles played  by the 100 household head and VTA, and the more socio religious side of the village led by informal leaders.

The reasons for this  tended to be old age, a reluctance to continue shouldering  the burden of local leadership, or the ability to maintain  family control by (informally) passing the position on to a  relative. 
At the time of research, they had faced no sanc tion from MADB.

Homes were  rebuilt, paddy field walls repaired, and new fishing boats  purchased.  
Several instances of buy ers from outside the community were reported, including businessmen from the township who bought up land along  the side of the main road leading through the village.
The literature indicates that the less prepared people and  institutions are for natural disasters, the more devastating  their impact will be. 
Investment in inter-village infrastructure is much more reli ant on government than village infrastructure and as such as  lagged behind. 
A higher amount of aid does not necessar ily reflect greater affectedness, however. 
45
In contrast, SIM 5 research found that the economic situa tion improved for most villages, across levels of affected ness.
The literature also underlines that the resilience of a commu nity is not static, as communities are complex and dynamic  social structures. 
Of course, this is not a binary decision; activities lie  along a spectrum with actions undertaken by households  purely focused on resilience (building a new home higher off  the ground), some fully focused on socioeconomic improve ments (buying a motorcycle to start a new taxi business but  also allowing the household to rapidly evacuate if necessary), while others emerge from mixed motivations (improv ing paddy field drainage).  
Where they existed, younger leaders  also received good reviews, as they were more willing to  travel to the township on behalf of the village than older  leaders and are seen as more active on behalf of the village,  especially when it comes to developing a strong network of  contacts at the township level. 
Other public services that have been funded and imple mented by either the community itself or outside actors  include embankments, electricity provision (two villages,  the first indication of the national electrification project),  mangrove plantations (three villages), a village administra tion office (two villages), and a community hall (two vil lages). 
Once a household’s major assets have been sold, migration  of at least one working-age adult is an extremely common  response.
Without a strategy, aid risks becoming irrelevant or  misapplied as the context within which it is being offered  is changing.  
Reducing exposure to disaster 
Formal Leaders 
In 2013, most of the  40 sample villages were struggling and had yet to recover socioeconomically.
Aid delivery worsened relations between religious groups  and led to splits within Christian and Buddhist, and Mus lim and Buddhist villages that persist to this day. 
This allowed for an extrap olation from the experiences of particular individuals or  households.

Factors driving new home designs  and building decisions 
Social pressure now also influences villagers’ decisions  to improve their homes. 
In two villages, women were elected as ten household leaders in  2013, the first time this had happened.
However, such  investments are expensive and out of reach for many small  farmers.  
In  eleven villages, some farmers told researchers that they had  chosen to let parts or all of their land lie fallow during the  2017 monsoon (either from the beginning of the season or  choosing not to replant after an early shock), as they did not  want to risk taking out additional loans that they were not  sure they would ever be able to pay back.

40 By way of example, the World Bank’s re-engagement in 2012  through the first approved project in 25 years (the National Com munity Driven Development Project) built on the findings of three  rounds of SIM and accompanying relations with civil society and  development partners. SIM also paved the way for Qualitative  Social and Economic Monitoring which, in six rounds from 2012  to 2017, expanded understanding of village social and economic  life across Myanmar significantly (see World Bank. 2017, op. cit.). 
First, the research team collected standardized data on vari ous dimensions of village life. 
In previous rounds of SIM, nonfarm enterprises that existed  in villages tended to offer just basic retail goods.
Not surprisingly, there fore, many of the SIM findings are reflected in the literature,  while others offer new insights.
Availability of  more (affordable) credit also remains an important asset.

It has become much easier for shopkeepers to keep goods in stock.  Before, they had to ask boatmen to go to town and buy goods, which could often take two days. 
While the SIM report does not seek to offer a specific climate change diagnosis for the Delta, there are a number of  observed changes that are linked to climate change. 
15 The registered individual receiving the loan is generally the head  of the household. However, as MADB only allows loans for ten  acres of land per person, larger farmers often register their land in the names of other family members, including their wife and daughters as necessary, to ensure they receive as large an MADB  loan as possible. In these cases, women do technically receive  MADB loans, but usage of that loan would be determined by the  household head.
“Before Nargis, only men were responsible for their house hold.

Up to early 2011, VTAs  were appointed by the township administration department  with or without consultation with the community. 
Relations within Village Groupings 
By 2017, due to the increased avail ability of employment and expanded migration opportunities, there are now very few who fish at subsistence levels  for their primary livelihood, though it is still common as a  secondary activity, especially during periods of little agri cultural activity.
SIM tracked these issues over time. Field visits during the  assessment observed a high level of unity and social cohesion among survivors, who had no doubt been brought  together by their common efforts to survive and rebuild.  
For example, if wages for the individual were K4,000  per day, workers in a group can earn between K5,000 and  K7,000 for the same activities, thanks to the increased pro ductivity associated with group labor.
This keeps the farmers current with MADB for another six  months.
He said “though the debt from purchasing a license is always between K400,000 and 500,000 we can pay  it back fully every year.”
In other words, these townships are amongst the  most disadvantaged in a region that is one of the most dis advantaged in the country.

Their ability to avoid debt increases  is due to both their limited need for finance (restricted to inputs) and their inability to take on much debt: once a small  farmer’s debt grows too high, he would likely need to sell  (part of) the land.

The quality of transportation infrastructure varies widely  across the SIM panel and is closely correlated with the  degree of affectedness in Nargis. 
Further, illegal but commonplace fishing techniques including poison, explosives, and electric shock both harm  the environment and hamper those fishers who attempt to  fish legally. 
The low interest rates and locally  determined payment terms have made the project popular  among villagers in the SIM panel, with many interviewees  commenting on how easy Evergreen loans are to repay.

Extensive training was offered to its members, and where feasible,  accompanying infrastructure built (especially storm shel ters). 
Of the 30 highly and moderately affected villages in the sample, only three moderately  affected ones did not have repayment problems.
•  The destruction of spawning grounds and the pressure  on livelihoods, linked to a post-disaster aid emphasis on  providing fishing equipment within the first year after  Nargis, led to overfishing in many rivers and streams.  Climate change would have eventually led to similar  results, but the cyclone accelerated this trend.

17 Villages with “good” social relations tended to have high lev els of unity/homogeneity and a high level of collective action  and trust in village leadership; those with “fair” social relations  tended to have less unity (e.g., with some groups not participating  in village affairs), some disagreement within the village on village development activities, and clear divides between supporters  and detractors of the current leadership; “poor” social relations  occurred in villages with multiple religious groups, where villagers  felt discriminated against by village or township authorities, and  where there was little unity or collective action.

The massive expansion  of migration over the past few years, however, has led to a  quantum change that has had a fundamental impact on the  local economy: higher disposable income for migrant house holds and less exposure to income variation due to other  external events. 
For women-headed households  with land, the process is a little different, but women play a  more active role in supervising laborers in the fields as they  must manage the process of land preparation directly.

The main  borrowers have traditionally been farmers, especially small  and medium farmers who require loans in order to finance  seeds, labor, and other inputs for their paddy rice crop.
In other cases, training programs  that accompany loans, such as for agricultural or livestock  rearing techniques, do not fit well with women’s other  responsibilities within the household.

The most recurrent theme was an increasing debt burden.
Inter-Ethnic and Inter-Religious  Social Relations
In  the case of fishing, for instance, SIM found that support  to small-scale fishers who had lost their boats overlooked  the vital role that middlemen, who had been directly and  indirectly impacted by Nargis, were playing for the proper  functioning of the local fishing sector.

At the same time, the infrastructure has improved  markedly over the years, especially with regard to housing, transport, and telecommunications. The Delta economy  relies more than in the past on farming, because the fish ing sector suffered from long-term decline. 
The drivers behind  this change are varied and their interplay complex, but a  recurring theme heard by researchers from respondents  was that aid programs that required women be involved in  community-level, decision-making bodies were an important component. 
Village leaders regularly collect sums of money from villagers for monastery  improvements, socioreligious events, or local infrastruc ture maintenance, and while the amounts are generally  based on household incomes, poor households struggle to  give what is expected.
If the disputants cannot find a solution, the first step  is to involve the village leader or village elder and, in most  cases, the issue ends there.
Second, fish scarcity has driven prices up.

Villages where infrastructure devel opment or renovation was slow, often attributed it to a lack  of manpower, poor connectivity to a township, and few job  opportunities compared to other villages. 
Particularly note worthy was the high turnover in highly affected villages as a  result of both elections. 
The Delta is highly exposed to the risk of  cyclones. 
While there are few formal plans and most are unwritten,  most villages and village leaders, primarily in highly and  moderately affected villages, reported both taking steps to  reduce risk and planning actively for the potential of a new  disaster.  
These leaders had  proven their willingness to contribute time, money, and  effort working for the development of the village. 
What if? 
The experience of villages across the SIM panel over the  nine years since Cyclone Nargis demonstrates both the  strengths of post-disaster aid and some of the challenges  such assistance has in helping households and communities rebuild their lives and livelihoods. 
Every ten households selected a representative who became  the 10 household head.

Daw Mya Aye and her sister would like to hire more local women to work for them and expand the business, but they  have been unable to do so because most of the young women in their village have migrated to Yangon.

For example, her younger brother founded a free  school in the village and later became a Yangon Regional Member of Parliament.  
Given their  position as the most visible local leaders, such turnover has  implications for local leadership dynamics—especially as  the appointment to 100 household head is often based on  personal relationships with the VTA rather than on ability or  administrative skill. 
Until recent years (and as shown in earlier rounds of  SIM), villages prioritized transportation infrastructure such  as roads and improved jetties that enabled improved market  access.
Farming Condition (2013)
For exam ple, the few Delta households that are able to buy and build  a second home in the township are inherently more resilient  to the effects of a rapid onset disaster because they face  reduced exposure to being without shelter, thereby also  reducing the risk that they might lose their lives in another  cyclone. 
The trend in Table 36 confirms, however,  the importance for development assistance that aims to provide sustainable benefits to place particular emphasis on  strengthening social relations.

The lowest reported price was K300,000 per acre for  paddy land located outside a protective embankment.

At the same time, post-disaster aid deliv ery mechanisms can lead to an increasing role of women  in local decision making.
This is compounded by  the fact that poorer households often lack access to formal  credit and have to take out loans from informal lenders at  much higher interest rates. 
These same leaders often determine  food contributed by the village that is kept at a central community building (often the monastery), make arrangements  for the wealthier villagers to contribute to local prepared ness activities, and make advance plans for villagers who  need shelter in town during a storm. 
In other cases, farmers have  worked to build small embankments, either by hand or by  renting machines, around their own paddy land in an effort  to reduce both flooding and the risk of pests.

Case Study 3: Entrepreneurship Improves Livelihood Outcomes
In recent years due to flooding or other  shocks, a farmer may need to replant at least once, result ing in increased job opportunities for laborers who do not  migrate.
Other weather shocks included unexpectedly timed rain  (i.e., before or after monsoon) which damaged crops, hail,  and, perhaps surprisingly, drought.
Lightly affected vil lages also lagged behind, likely a reflection of aid disparities  between lightly affected villages and others in the SIM panel.  
As a result, larger farmers either  sought to rent out or frequently sell land they viewed as  extra to their needs, especially given the more diverse  investment opportunities that now exist in many SIM villages or the opportunity to buy land or houses in town.

But these livelihoods face systemic threats of climate change and labor short ages that will limit their role as both pillars of income and  employment for the Delta population. 
This development deficit  is not a result of Nargis, however; available 2004/05 data  for Ayeyarwady region indicate high rates of poverty in this  area (relative to other regions and states) years before the  cyclone.  
Four years on, the same lessons can be  drawn, with the additional point that outside assistance can  have both longer term positive and negative social effects. 
For both land pawning and ‘money return–land return’ systems, the amount of cash the farmer can expect to receive is  significantly less than the market value—generally between  one-half and one-third of the mutually accepted market  value of the land.
Five years after Nargis, Delta villages still found them selves in a dire economic situation.

Government, (national and international) NGOs, and village  self-help groups are the most common sources of funding  for local infrastructure projects. 
Immediately following Nargis, the ability of formal,  government-appointed leaders and informal leaders (espe cially religious leaders and respected individuals) to work  together helped during the critical relief and early recovery  phase. 
Previous rounds of SIM research found that the quality of soil was an important determinant of what a farmer could expect his land to produce. In SIM 5, in large part due to more frequent flooding acroos the SIM panel, soil quality's importance has declined and the location of a farmer's land  (i.e., whether it is at a higher elevation away from major rivers) is now the most important  determinant of yield.
On holidays, he  cleaned the factory compound for a side income and also worked as a security guard at night.  
This finding of  a more general tension between religious groups reflects a  concerning trend of growing localized intolerance toward  religious minorities across Myanmar (Case Study 7).

Since 2013 and the accompanying expansion of govern ment services, VTAs also liaise more with other government  departments both in the village tract itself and in visits to  the township. 
This was linked to a growing anger over license  fees, with fishers feeling that despite increasing costs, they  received no active support from the fisheries department  and when wronged, they had no recourse.
Analysis of the SIM 5 research and evaluations by the  research team found that of the SIM villages, just six vil lages were considered resilient with another eleven some what resilient. 
The resilience focus explored how households and commu nities adapt to the dual contexts of a post-natural disaster reality and the effects of climate change that have increased  the frequency of weather shocks and other associated challenges.

The increasing willingness of villagers  to be vocal in their opposition to certain VTA decisions was  also a reason cited by some former VTAs as a contributing  factor to their retirement.

This happened despite the need for  such efforts remaining undiminished.
Fishing’s profitability is very much dependent on village location.
Paddy fields cannot be moved  and villages are also (mostly) immobile. 
The most grassroots level of official leadership recognized  by the Myanmar government is the Village Tract Administrator who, while not a formal employee of the central bureau cracy, the General Administration Department (GAD), is linked to it and receives a stipend from it. 
Migration 
From 2013 the household also had a business charging batteries with a solar panel.
Wealthy businessmen in the village also often have an infor mal leadership role.

Fishers complained that large fishing boats now fish in  shore and along the river rather than staying offshore.
If additional labor is required, households try  to hire labor, but as catch sizes have dwindled it has become  more common for women to go on the boats, especially  when retrieving the nets.

Prior to Nargis, U Mg Mg was a well-off farmer: he owned over 20 acres of land and two boats while also working as a  rice broker.
The clearest example of this shift toward prioritization of  different forms of infrastructure is embankments, newly  emphasized for their contributions to farming livelihoods  and village safety. 
Availability of affordable credit 
Total 
Agricultural extension services are an important tool to  improving agricultural returns. 
Villagers  in SIM 5 were more aware of credit terms, of interest rates  and models for calculating them, and of social security fund  incentives for various credit sources.
Farming  yields had rebounded since the disaster by over 15 percent  on average and by many more farmers growing both monsoon and summery paddy.
However, SIM 5 research indicates that the consolidation  of land has slowed and that for small and medium farmers  land sales continues to be a last resort.
Without  borrowing each planting season, many farmers have no abil ity to buy agricultural inputs.
Villagers also reported  that larger trees are some of the only things that were not washed away in the storm.

Over time, the experience of the SIM villages mirrored  those of similar efforts in other countries. 
As a result, many fishers lost their traditional  livelihoods and became casual laborers at a time when farmers were reducing their demand for labor even further.

Youth par ticipation in village affairs has decreased significantly, with  the exception of a small number of occasions when migrant  workers return to their homes.
Health  
For fishers, especially, these bulletins determine  their livelihood activities, as they will no longer take their  boats out if a storm is expected.  
While the situation facing SIM villages has no doubt  improved over the past four years, their position remains  tenuous.  
The costs associated with farming have consistently gone  up, thus harvest price increases have done little to improve  the condition of most farmers (Table 4).
The more highly valued land was  either along the main roads purchased by businessmen from  outside the village, or was high quality paddy land (i.e., at  a higher elevation) bought by larger farmers from indebted  smaller farmers.

The process took time, and midway  through the process, the nurse was reassigned to a new location.  
Even though five health centers were built over the past four  years, for a total of 17 in the panel, more than half of SIM  villages still do not have one.

Table 16 highlights this distribution of (self reported) debt.
This section summarizes  salient findings from the first four rounds of SIM to provide a  longitudinal snapshot of how the village context has evolved  across the panel over more than nine years.

(In  SIM 1, no villages had DRR committees but 27 had formed  emergency committees to manage post-Nargis relief activi ties.) 
Indebtedness was directly related to the degree of cyclone affected ness.
Under new legislation, villages are  not required to have cookie cutter standing committees,  and organic groups have taken their place.
SIM 4
The combination  of Nargis and these more recent events had affected liveli hoods in some villages to such a degree that they appeared  to have lost their ability to self recover. 
2013
Community-based disaster risk management 
This is because many households either cannot contribute  (because those who might volunteer labor have migrated) or  they are busy with their own livelihoods.
Desire for better living conditions, realization of the importance of a sturdy  home during a storm, and social pressure of comparing  homes with their neighbors were the main reported drivers  of housing improvements.

Never
Though difficult to quantify, not least since the land  tenure system changed significantly with the introduction  of the Farmland Law enacted in 2012, land ownership has  become more unequal in several villages by SIM 4, with a  smaller proportion of households owning their own farms.  
Myanmar is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change, with a coastline stretching more than  6,000 kilometers and a majority of its population living in areas deemed ‘climate change exposed.’

Connectivity (the absence of year-round via ble transport infrastructure in particular) is clearly an aspect  of the area’s development deficit. 
The lenders for  all three types of land loans tend to be larger farmers within  the village, relatives, or farmers from neighboring villages.

VTAs are also responsible for dispute  resolution, leading village activities focused on both social  and development efforts, conveying news to and from the  township, and other activities deemed by the VTA to be in  the village tract’s interest. 
Transportation infrastructure and connectivity  have improved since 2013, but many villages  continue to lack basic social infrastructure
Whereas in  previous years the position was seen as a key associate of  the 100 household head, helping to maintain village order  and ensuring security, today their role is greatly reduced.  
In previous rounds of SIM, subsistence  fishers made up a small but measurable proportion of most  villages’ population.

In the best of circumstances, villagers  mobilized to redirect the assistance according to their own  identified needs—with or without the agreement of the aid  provider. 
Alongside his farming, he also worked as a casual laborer when the planting season ended, and as a carpenter.
However, the international expe rience also suggests that the memories of many disaster affected communities fade with time. 
1–2 Years  after  Nargis 
At the same time, the challenges of being entrepreneurial in the aftermath of a disaster and the lack of enough work ing family members to assist in rebuilding livelihoods were  evident challenges. 
Beyond the destruction caused by Nargis, the  Ayeyarwady Delta has experienced regular flooding, occasional droughts, pest infestations, and a wide variety of other  weather and climate-linked challenges.

There are economic relations between the two religious groups with  both sides saying they buy from and sell to members of the  other religion and do not feel cheated.
Well before the planting or harvest ing seasons, farmers provide advance amounts in exchange  for a promise that the laborer will come and work on their  fields at a designated time.

The particular  value added by SIM 5, however, is the longitudinal compari son over nine years across a panel of 40 villages, offering a unique window into the daily lives of villagers in an area  severely devastated by a major natural disaster well beyond  the timeframe of normal recovery assessments.

Consequently, the villagers became cautious in their interaction with households of a different religion.
At the same time, households still do not command a strong  entrepreneurial spirit, and their access to economic assets  remains more limited, which weakens their capacity to  recover. 
He worked as a small fisherman, carried  water to government staff houses, and during the summer season worked as a permanent farming laborer. Later he did  construction work as day laborer.  
This development reflects broader changes in local leadership in  rural Myanmar.

Despite the application for a new center still being processed, the VTA made no effort to get approval from the township  administration. 
He took a loan of K500,000 to pay for the license fees and the new net from the village fish collector, and  as part of his repayment sells his fish only to that collector.

For exam ple, some farmers reported that in some years their paddy  harvest had average yields, but the quality was poor, gener ally meaning high moisture rates, discoloration of the rice,  and higher risk of mold, resulting in low prices and a result ing loss overall for their investment from that season’s crop.

At the same time, the insistence of longer term  aid projects to have women contribute to leadership struc tures and decision making has been an important enabler of  new roles for women across various aspects of village life.

First, there are the many non-governmental  organizations (NGOs) active in the Delta, many of whom  have focused on improving the quality of the seeds used by  farmers.
Even more remote villages have improved employment  opportunities though they are more limited.
This confirms the importance  of policy-level engagement already in the immediate post disaster period, which in turn needs to be grounded in a  deep understanding of context. 
For the three-year  period, the land is ‘owned’ by the lender who can farm it  himself or rent it to a tenant farmer.
Availability of land 
The region’s close proximity to Yangon and the rap idly growing construction and garment sectors there have  proven massive draws for villagers across the SIM panel.
One clear way to lessen the impact of a disaster is to reduce  how exposed one is to it and its long-term effects.

The rise of mobile telecommu nications around Myanmar has been well covered by jour nalists and researchers alike, and its impact is seen across  the SIM panel. 
They hire labor only from their Muslim community, which has caused some resentment among Bamar labor ers who feel they have fewer job opportunities.
As  a result, since the most recent election in 2015, mass meet ings are normally only called to discuss government service  delivery or other outside support, and most meetings report edly focus on education access, the arrival of MADB loans,  or National Community Driven Development and Evergreen  Village Development program activities.
Across the SIM panel, farmers reported that the monsoon in recent years has become unpredict able in its timing, shorter in its duration, and more intense in its storms. 
The ubiquity in 2017 of mobile devices and 3G has meant  that information delivered via social media has rapidly  become one of the most important tools for village pre paredness. 
Compared to SIM 4, village leaders in SIM 5 saw a similar proportion of young  leaders (between the ages of 18 and 45) but a significant  reduction in the proportion of well-educated leaders (either  a high school graduate or having attended university).
In one village, the lobster fishers now  bypass township-level markets entirely and sell directly to  a broker in Yangon for several times the price available to  them locally. 
Instead, with a small number of exceptions, the forces affect ing social dynamics in SIM villages are reflective of broader  trends found across Myanmar that are, in some cases, exac erbated by Nargis’ legacy.

However, villages often still face challenges accessing  fresh water during the dry season, when salt water intrusion into the water ponds is common. 
Farmers strug gle to hire labor that has left for better opportunities in the  towns and Yangon and even migrate seasonally themselves.  Fishers discontented with reduced catches and uncertain returns migrate seasonally, or in some villages have taken  their whole household and left the village behind.

As the required groups disappeared, there has been an  accompanying increase in the number of local charity-type  organizations formed at the village level.
The Evergreen chairwoman was interviewed about the program as part of the SIM 5 research.
Social links to  towns and Yangon also provide a safety net. 
Throughout this analysis, care must be taken to recognize  the distinctions between slow and rapid onset disasters.

The most salient findings  include the following.  
The  slight decline in livelihood centric aid reflects a logical  decline in the impact of livelihood assistance, as people’s  occupations were returning to an appearance of normal.  
While these remittances can  provide enough for survival, the experiences of many debt ridden villagers suggest they still often struggle to pay the  interest on their loans, let alone the principal.
SIM 5 research made clear that one of the most important  indicators of a village’s agricultural outcomes was the presence of embankments protecting at least paddy fields (if not  the entire village) from the damaging effects of flooding and  salt water intrusion.  
In addition, local job opportunities also  strengthen their resilience capacity, as do better health of  family members, a larger number of working family mem bers, and a greater ability to manage household resources.  
Consequently, villages hit by Nargis had to contend not just with the dev astation wrought upon by the disaster but also historically  high poverty and underdevelopment compared to the rest  of the region and country. 
This assistance often takes the form  of renting farmland, lending farming tools, giving loans, and  offering space to live or raise livestock (most commonly  ducks) (Case Study 5).

Myanmar’s national migration boom greatly affected the  Delta, with many landless laborers moving to Yangon or  other parts of the country in search of improved economic  opportunities.
In these cases, villag ers reported that the VTA would rarely visit other tract vil lages and, in response, the other villages in the tract would  try hard to remove that VTA and install one from their own  village.

Three types of fishing take place in the Ayeyarwady Delta.
Despite the high levels of debt facing  Delta households, however, many continue to borrow, with  farmers in particular saying they have little choice.

These vil lages have a variety of activities not seen in more remote villages, such as December sport competitions.

An overview of farming in the Delta
At the  same time, highly affected villages now report very strong  social relations and cohesion, based at least in part on their  close brush with death.
Private sources of credit remain common throughout SIM  villages where they range from semiformal lenders to more  informal arrangements, such as large farmers who lend to  their smaller farmer neighbors or local input suppliers providing seeds or fertilizer on loan.
Licensing  rules vary significantly, not just depending on the type of  fish being caught or the types of nets used, but from town ship to township as well.
The election for the Evergreen committee had not yet occurred by the time of this research.

The  post-disaster relief and recovery aid had only limited specific support for women, though clearly a range of activities  benefited them as much as or more than men, for instance  in water and sanitation. 
Further to this, disaster relief and  recovery efforts may sometimes generate new risks instead  of facilitating the conditions required to build longer term  social resilience—by setting up parallel delivery mechanisms in the absence of state measures or bypassing local  communities and community groups in decision making.

 And yet, the SIM series has shed  unprecedented light on a recovery process from devastation  that has had as many twists and turns, and as many paths,  as the Ayeyarwady Delta itself. 
In each, between four and eight  informants were interviewed together. 
Part of the change is attributable to  the phasing out of lower quality paddy and farmers’ focus  on better seeds.

The  most common fish species is the hilsa, but fishers catch, eat,  and sell a wide variety of fish both as fresh and for drying or  production into fish paste (ngapi, a staple of the Myanmar  diet).

Significant coopera tion helped those villages with strong social capital get by  in the first years after Nargis. 
Post-disaster aid that  seeks to rebuild a shattered socio-economy cannot afford to ignore the trajectories of these livelihoods and must antici pate and adapt to the changing shape of Myanmar’s rural,  rice producing economies.  
Housing quality has improved significantly  across the SIM panel, though a few notable  exceptions exist

As shown in Table 29, there  have been a higher number of transportation infrastructure  projects (116) than any other sector, with a roughly even  split between government-funded, NGO-funded, and village funded activities.

As this was not enough to pay for all inputs, the government has worked to increase MADB loan size over time.
To date, extensions services, especially trainings, across  the SIM panel have been both infrequent and the exclusive  domain of NGO providers. 
“The soil has become sour and we have to use more fertilizer;  if we do not use it, the plants will not grow well.”
Wages
Their improved position is a  reflection of three major interlinked trends that exist across  the SIM panel and across much of Myanmar: higher wages for agricultural jobs, new job opportunities, and expanded  migration.
Poor 
But it is  for laborers that the migration boom has been most trans formational, providing important new opportunities for  income diversification and advancement, particularly for  households with more than one adult able to work.
The long-term trend that SIM found, however, indicates that  while social relations within and between villages are still  good a decade after Nargis, they are less strong then they  used to be. 
Second, there are the companies  selling inputs to farmers. Many of these, especially fertil izer salespeople, also provide information on best prac 
Village meetings in 2017 only occur occasionally and VTA  elections are even more infrequent.

Land at higher elevations produced  more reliable yields, even if the soil was not necessarily as  fertile as some low-lying plots.
There are three ways  in which land is used as collateral for loans.
Beyond challenges posed by weather shocks, variable yields,  and fluctuating prices, the outcomes of farming are influ enced by several other factors. Perhaps the most important  of these is land location.
SIM aimed to understand the changing needs and priorities  of the affected communities over time, as well as how the local socio-economy, social relations, and village institutions were evolving—both as a result of Nargis and due to  the effects of aid provision.
The Ayeyarwady Delta has in many ways recovered from the  most obvious effects of Nargis.

Similarly, debt levels are  higher for all livelihood groups in highly affected villages,  and there is more borrowing against land. 
There are a number of key  lessons to be learnt from the experience of SIM villages in  recent years, particularly around disaster preparedness,  embankments, and the role of locally driven development.

A wide variation in yields from harvest to harvest has also  led to some changes in farmers’ behavior, with farmers  beginning to diversify their income sources.

In larger villages  with more than 100 households, one of the 100 household  heads is sometimes informally designated as the ‘village  administrator.’ 
Good access to 3G Internet is beginning to affect the local  economy, as well as allowing villagers to easily communi cate with friends and family beyond the village. 
At  the monthly NLD party meeting the Member of Parliament advised her directly to explain the case to the more senior  district-level DRD office.
Migrating women are a key source of remittances back to  the villages—over 60 percent of garment workers send back  money, often every month—and this income has allowed  many families to improve their quality of life, finance education, build new homes, and invest in new or additional  livelihoods.
The literature also dis tinguishes between recovery of individuals and recovery of communities and notes that vulnerability to disaster  impacts is dynamic and shaped by interconnected shocks  and stresses.

The ability to engage in such harm reduction is a reflection  of two broad sets of actions. 
Previous SIM research found many households carried sig nificant levels of interest-bearing debt from a variety of  government-subsidized and private sources.

Women also played an  expanded leadership role in some cases by default: as livelihood opportunities improved, men were frequently too busy  to engage in village affairs and so women replaced their hus bands’ positions, including in some cases as 10 household  heads.

The dissolution of the State Peace  and Development Council in March 2011, began a multiyear  process of change that included national elections in 2015,  several local and by-elections, as well as significant economic reforms that have opened up the country to foreign  business and investment.

SIM 4 was undertaken in April and  May 2013, in the same 40 villages studied in the earlier rounds.
Microfinance activities, by both NGOs and  private sector entities, have also increased.

The assessment of whether a village had  recovered was based on the extent to which old liveli hoods were now delivering sustainable positive returns,  the effect of new economic opportunities (both in the vil lage and beyond) on the household, the current state of  social relations, perceptions of local leaders, and the state  of village infrastructure.

Depending on the village context, the following groups were  invited to participate in focus group discussions: farmers,  fishers, laborers, small business owners, religious or ethnic  minorities, women (particularly female head of households),  members of local groups (such as women’s lending groups or  DRR committees), youth, and other vulnerable groups iden tified by the research team. 
Table 35 shows the capacity for recovery of the households  in the 40 SIM villages by the factors ranked as important  (i.e., ‘1’) in Table 32 above within the first two years and nine  years after Nargis (as well as social networks). 
Indeed, as Chapter 7 shows, remittances are a  central contributor to a household’s resilience.

The challenge on  local leaders is two-fold. 
For example, as labor has become more expensive, farm ers have turned to mechanization, broadcasting instead of  seedling transplanting, and increasing the use of chemical  additives to reduce their labor costs.
In the Delta, Cyclone  Nargis is no longer the defining livelihood issue for most communities, as more time- and location-specific issues  have taken a central role.
There are two labor actions that have affected wages and  the relationship between farmers and laborers. The first is  the expansion of labor groups.

Karen-Bamar  villages experienced similar issues, with the Karen seen by  the Bamar as unified and self-supporting while the Bamar  (often a minority in these villages) suffered.
One of the most important issues for communities in the  years following Nargis was ensuring there was a village  building able to withstand bad storms in the future. 
Returns from fishing
This has continued into SIM 5.
The Delta’s economy is already beginning to move away  from labor intensive farming and fishing methods even as  village social structures work to adapt to a new reality where  village populations are smaller with far fewer young people  to maintain traditions.

He thus stayed in the village and started working as a  money lender, providing loans at low interest rates to villagers. 
Fishing and the degree of affectedness are linked in that  a larger proportion of highly affected villages have fishing  sectors.

As a  result, debt among fishing households reflects large debts  taken on for livelihood investment, often from township level businesses or fish brokers.
Before Nargis, his family used to be among the  poorest in the village, living in a home with a nipa palm roof and bamboo walls. 
The literature assigns social capital a critical role in the  recovery process, with some arguing that it serves as the core  engine of recovery.

A major disaster  can alter the socio-economic trajectory of a household, a  community, and a region for at least several years, some times several decades, and sometimes, forever.
The literature reveals that those who are already poor and  socially vulnerable, or who have not yet recovered from a  previous disaster, are at a higher risk, as they are more likely  to lack adequate resources to buffer them against hazard  impacts.

Table 34 shows that approximately one-half  of highly and moderately villages were resilient or some what resilient but less than one-third of the lightly affected  ones. 
Final Reflections 
There was an  increasing number of instances where aid-related tensions  weakened social relations.
The VTA is also respon sible for informing the township administration when a  flood or other disaster occurs in the tract and for passing  information, including on the weather, from the township to  other villagers, generally by use of a loudspeaker.

They generally attributed it to communi ties becoming more ‘business-minded’ and individualistic  while at the same time improved job availability and better  wages meant people have less free time to help one another.
Within the village, especially those  villages with good access to larger towns, landless house holds frequently reported using their expanded access to  affordable credit (via both government programs and micro-finance lenders) to invest in new income-generating activi ties, including small grocery shops, motorcycles for taxi  services, and even mobile phone shops.

Due to a strong social fabric, Ayeyarwady Delta communities  stayed resilient despite the challenges. In most aspects of  village life, there was little change and social relations were  good.

Researchers assessed the impor tance of these factors within 1–2 years after Nargis (SIM 2  and 3) and 9 years after Nargis (SIM 5).  
Across SIM’s 40 study villages, the research  team evaluated that 25, or almost two-thirds,  have now recovered from the effects of Nargis

The effect of this decline in village social life stems from leaders’ reduced  ability to organize the community for collective action.

Small-scale conflicts, generally between households, are  relatively frequently of minor issues across many SIM villages.
Villages and groups  (socioeconomic, livelihood, and other) within those villages  recovered differently and at different paces, with few lin ear trajectories for recovery visible in the experiences of  the SIM panel. 
The latter was blamed on both  changes to the rivers’ flow which had seen the water become  more brackish and also on fertilizer-polluted run-off from  farmers’ fields.

Youth groups’ declining role in village affairs
The clearest disruption to the social fabric has been  the massive migration outflow from the Delta to Yangon and  beyond that has left many villages with few young people to  take on either their parents’ livelihoods or carry on village  social life.

As in SIM 4, MADB remains the most common and the most important credit source for farmers across the panel villages.
The  second group are fishers from villages that lie along the  major rivers forming the main waterways of the Delta.

The VTA responded that the approval had been granted due to his administration’s work and his village should also benefit.
Across  the sample villages, villagers have taken to strengthening  their roof and fastening it better to the frame. 
Other common issues include lots of garbage  being found in nets (fishers in several villages reported they  sometimes catch more plastic waste than fish) and that  tides, and the resulting catch, have become less predictable  in recent years.
In broad terms, SIM finds that the post-Nargis response is no  exception to this general male bias. 
Radio, and more recently  satellite television, are now used to get up-to-date weather  forecasts.

She also has  connections with the local NLD party leadership—she was named village tract NLD chair after the general election—and  contested the 2015 VTA election as a 10 household head, though she was defeated.
Population movements, declines in income and asset prices, and apparent perma nent shifts in sectors of economic activity are amongst the  most prevalent manifestations.  
In some cases, loans are  disbursed by household, which may limit a woman’s access  relative to her husband.

This group allows the township administrator to  rapidly disseminate information across the township, allows  VTAs to provide updates to the township administrator, and  allows VTAs to communicate with each other, sharing relevant news. 
Consequently, aid that is not well  planned or executed is likely to create, or exacerbate, social  tensions that can persist over a long time.  
Village leadership opportunities, previously almost exclu sively restricted to men, are expanding, albeit slowly, to  women.

Social factors behind new houses 
First,  even in villages that are considered recovered, there are  households that had been poor or near-poor prior to Nargis  and have found themselves in destitution ever since. 
12 
While this appeared to be a common  and largely anodyne practice, there were cases where the  expense of a new home had driven households deeply into  debt.  
Since 2013 the number of village-level credit programs  accessible to landless households has grown significantly  with both government (Cooperative Department, Evergreen  Loan program) and microfinance providers now offering  loans.
Out-migration after  the economic transformation began would have cre ated labor shortages at any rate, but due to Nargis these  appeared earlier.

These  rivers can reach a mile wide and have traditionally provided  a sustainable livelihood for the fishers living along their  banks, though since Nargis this livelihood is on the decline.

Farmers reported that two or three months after the  peak harvest season, the price for paddy, especially the highest quality (i.e., export) varieties, could be 15–50 percent  higher, depending on the year, than what they are normally  able to sell their crop for.

The immediate effects of natural disasters are clear.
Interviewed fishers also noted that they have received  little assistance in recent years, highlighting the inequity  between livelihood assistance programs for farmers and the  paucity of fishing-focused activities by both donors and the  government.

MADB’s expansion and the expanding presence of  microfinance since 2013 received a positive response from  villagers, though fishers reported that they continued to  have less access to finance than other groups.
Unlike in other parts of Myanmar where migrants tend to  skew male, the number of migrants out of SIM villages  are slightly more female.
Her ability to manage both the  social and financial aspects of the VTA role has won her the respect of most villagers, though she is disliked by some  casual laborers because she has imposed fines for certain activities (including unlicensed fishing and cutting bamboo)  and providing only those people she thinks are financially deserving with the recommendation required to take a loan. 
Resolution of such disputes generally occurs at the village level.

Credit needs for fishing livelihoods differ structurally from  farming; instead of annual inputs, fishing requires a capital input that is then used for several years.

A common com plaint was that when, as often happens, offshore fishing  boats run over their nets, damaging or destroying them,  there is no one for the small fishers to turn to for justice.

Physical assets  such as cash, gold, harvested paddy, and food stocks are  inherently at risk because of their location, and it is difficult  for many households to move these goods or eliminate their  exposure to a potential disaster.

The proportion of this sort of fishers in any given village  varies depending on the village’s location, but they are by  far the most common type of fishers across the SIM panel. 
As discussed in the following  chapter, this change is reflected in land value, with plots  deemed to be in good locations having significantly higher  sale prices.

The SIM series used time-tested social research methods.  Based on the early SIM experience, the methodology and  tools were adapted to post-disaster contexts to capture  post-disaster social impacts across thematic areas (relief,  recovery, and resilience; socioeconomic impacts; social  relations and cohesion; and local leadership and institutions) and identify and monitor the effectiveness of recov ery and aid efforts in the medium to longer term.41

As a result, the VTA, who has held that title since the first VTA elec tions in 2013, rarely visits the village and only when he cannot avoid it.  
The Delta is one  of Myanmar’s most vulnerable regions, given its proximity to the ocean and cyclones, its low elevation, the reliance of  its population on agricultural production, and its limited infrastructure. 
SIM 5 analysis shows  that there is little difference in the overall economic standing of highly and lightly affected villages, with regard to both  farming and fishing. 
Major challenges to economic development remain,  though they are most closely linked to systemic issues of  climate, lack of infrastructure, and access to improved farm ing methods rather than long-term effects of Nargis or an  inability to find a job.

The data indicate that while in some years prices are high, there  is little consistency and farmers face frequent swings in the  amount they can expect to earn from their harvests.
Again, this helped determine sources  of variation in outcomes and experiences, between and  within villages. 
“This year, I diversified the business and I am both raising  ducks and planting betel vines.

Various nonfarm enterprises have declined, particularly  those that required substantial labor.
Another five villages without  embankments said they viewed them as a high priority.

After matriculating he went to Yangon and made a plan with some friends to move abroad. 
As a matter of fact, while aid is  generally focused on the poor, other livelihood groups (espe cially larger farmers) also merit recovery support as they are  an important employer of local labor.
The new recommended criteria on age and education set by  the government for the VTA under the 2012 law also con tributed to leadership changes in 2015, namely that the VTA  must be at least 25 years of age, have ‘sufficient resources  for his livelihood’ and a ‘fair education.’ 
These changes were not limited to the Ayeyarwady Delta;  a recent report found government assistance projects more  than tripled between 2013 and 2015.19

While transportation infrastructure improvements were a  regularly cited need in many communities and there is some  evidence of a new focus by both government and self-help,  community driven projects, the villages most vulnerable to  Nargis-like storms remain both poorly connected to urban  centers and fully dependent on water transport. 
This unity over prioritization ends at transportation, how ever. Health and education infrastructure is dominated  by government funding, with a total of 36 projects across  the panel compared to 21 for NGO and villages sources combined. 
In the tenth year after the disaster,  the memories of Nargis have faded somewhat, and despite  regular flooding and the experience of smaller cyclones  in the past several years, the urgency to spend significant  time and money preparing for disasters is gone from all but  the villages worst affected by Nargis.

Oftentimes, those with  land are forced to sell it, and at a lower price if the earning  potential from land is affected by the disaster. 
In recent years, the  expansion of the government’s Evergreen program, the Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund, and the World Bank financed National Community Driven Development Program  have sought to enable local solutions to local challenges of  credit access and community infrastructure.  
Reviewing infrastructure projects by affectedness, there  appears to be some correlation between affectedness and  the number of projects but this depends on the funding  source (Table 30).

The Evergreen Village Development Program, which is financed by a loan from the Chinese  government, started in 2015 and was already active across  the country in about 4,500 villages by 2016; it has a pres ence in 14 SIM villages (which is proportionally high for a  40-village sample).

The implications for laborers is that there are both  expanded opportunities to work for themselves rather than  for a business and that they have improved access to better  jobs in town rather than being restricted to opportunities  within their village.

Second, there have been strong and continuous shifts in eco nomic activity ever since Nargis across all livelihood groups,  and in multiple directions. 
All these  forces have shaped how leaders are selected, how they are  evaluated in the eyes of the communities, and what their  local role has become.20

Third, the researchers also conducted informal inter views and participant observation. 
Moreover, Muslims were not allowed to celebrate their Eid al-Adha. The  relationship between the two religious groups has thus been damaged.
In some ways, much of the Delta’s  population has moved beyond the micro-finance programs  designed for their needs five years ago and are increasingly  in need of credit opportunities that allow for longer term,  larger scale investments in economic activities.

Improving  these religious structures (strengthened monasteries were  observed in eight villages, churches in two villages) served  a dual purpose therefore, both as a religious building and  as a way to reduce the impact of disasters, and has been  a key focus of community self-help activities since Nargis.  
Households are altering the kinds of homes they build based  on their experience with Nargis and other weather shocks,  as well as expectations of what the effects of climate change  may bring. 
Of SIM’s 40 villages, 16 were assessed as having high levels  of migration (at least 25 percent of households having at  least one migrant member) with an additional 15 with mod erate levels of migration (at least 10 percent of households  with a migrant) (Table 13).
Formal Leaders 
Over the previous nine years, SIM has focused on how com munities have recovered in the aftermath of a rapid onset  disaster such as Nargis. 
While better access to  improved inputs is an important step that many farmers in  the Delta now have, their ability to take full advantage of the  potential increases in return is limited by a lack of access to  knowledge about alterative farming methods.

•  Nargis led to labor shortages that in turn led farmers to  use more machinery and fertilizer.

The  experience of most 100 household heads is the clearest  example of this decline. 
There are other social differences, such as the fact that while  both groups in some villages could cooperate on commu nity infrastructure, this was not always the case.
Higher and more  violent tides are common, with the fishing villages that dot the Myanmar coast and lie alongside the Delta’s major rivers  reporting regular flooding—something that prior to Nargis was an annual or even more infrequent occurrence.

Local leaders in these communities included wealthier individuals who could make large cash contributions to their  villages’ development, could pay for labor costs where others could not, and had both a strong interest in developing  the village and good networks beyond the community upon  which they could call. 
While findings from SIM are representative only of the vil lages where fieldwork was conducted, triangulation with  other data sources suggests that many findings may apply  more broadly across Nargis-affected areas.

 Mostly, however, informal leaders engage in event  organization for religious occasions, organizing collective  action for village infrastructure development and social wel fare, dealing with nongovernment outside actors for local  needs, and a very informal role in local dispute resolution  (providing advice where to go and whom to approach).  
While later development aid  applied a similar approach to enhance women’s roles,  these efforts were arguably facilitated by the earlier  experience with aid providers.

Two  critical ingredients to recovery and resilience that require  the attention of aid providers as well are social capital both  within and across communities and with the local adminis tration, and the quality and commitment of local leaders, both formal and informal.
In some cases, fishers reported that they would scuttle  their boats to protect them from a storm surge, refloating  them after the storm had passed. 
The concentration of administrative responsibility has had  mixed effects on SIM villages depending on their relation ship with their VTA. 
The villagers complained that the VTA’s neglect delays the development of the village.

Similar examples appear across thematic areas. 
Finally, there are a range of social enterprises seek ing to commoditize agricultural extension via soil testing  kits, demonstration plots, and other extension products.
In SIM 5, interviewed villagers identified other  attributes they felt were necessary for a good leader. 
The outmigration from  SIM villages was also a significant contributor to higher  wages, as farmers had to pay laborers more to ensure their  crops were harvested.
In previous  rounds of SIM farming, households were much less likely to  diversify than fishers or casual laborers. Farmers’ reticence  to diversify reflected both a comparatively reduced need to  migrate as a coping strategy (given land’s value as an asset)  and the farming-specific need to remain close to their land  during the growing season.

Village respondents frequently attributed recovery from disasters and improved development standing to the quali fications and abilities of their village leader. 
In particular, until out-migration  opened a much-needed escape route from poverty for land less laborers, their ability to take out loans was constrained  by their lack of creditworthiness.

In the months after Nargis, panel villages located  in the eight most disaster-affected townships were selected  to ensure: (a) wide geographic coverage to take account of  the level of remoteness; (b) variation in predominant village  livelihood types (in rough proportion to the importance of  those livelihoods in the Delta economy); and (c) variation in  the degree of initial affectedness by Nargis.42

Nonetheless, storing of paddy, seeds, cash, gold, and other  valuable assets and documents in protected places (burying, storing in their home’s attic, or keeping them in town  were common methods) are perceived as important steps in  disaster protection.
Alongside SIM’s core research questions, taking stock of  changes to a village’s socio-economy, social relations, and  development situation, SIM 5 added a new component in  an effort to reflect on how Nargis, and the ensuing delivery of aid, altered the trajectory of communities and their  recovery process.

Based on existing lit erature and the experience of previous rounds of SIM, resil ience in the Delta was defined as the ability to both reduce  the impact of a disaster and recover more rapidly when a  disaster strikes.  
Moreover, Cyclone Nargis drastically reduced the opportuni ties for paid work for laborers, who faced reduced demand  for their labor from the bigger farmers and fishers who  would normally employ them.
Introduction of Social Protection

The literature points out consistently that recovery is an  ongoing process that unfolds over time and can continue until the next event. 
In lightly affected villages, households had  a higher level of capacity when it came to using their existing  economic assets for recovery, while the villages more badly  affected by Nargis had seen most of their assets destroyed  and could not count on them to aid in recovery. 
Finally, case studies on the experiences of particular fami lies and groups in Nargis-affected villages were created.

28 For the purposes of SIM, ‘aid’ refers to all types of aid received,  both cash and in-kind and across multiple sectors. All types of aid  providers from outside villages, such as government, local and  international NGOs, United Nations agencies, private sector aid  providers, and religious groups, are referred to in the SIM series as  ‘aid providers’, as villagers themselves did not tend to distinguish  among different kinds of sources of assistance.

Developing resilience consists of two broad baskets of  activities: those that reduce a household’s or community’s  exposure to the threat of damage and those that improve  protection of people and assets.
As the loans began to be disbursed, her village’s leader and some other villagers  became dissatisfied about how the money was being distributed.
Variance in terms and conditions
Township-level fisheries depart ments appear to develop their own licensing procedures.
Instead, by returning to 40 villages across  the Ayeyarwady Delta and giving villagers the opportunity  to reflect on their social and economic experiences since  Nargis, SIM aims to improve global understanding of the  long-term effects of natural disasters and the role of disas ter relief.
Fishers across  the SIM panel reported being much more cautious about  when they took their boats out, more aware of the weather  forecasts and storm potential, and more likely to take steps  to prevent their equipment from being damaged, like prop erly fastening nets to the riverbed with long bamboo sticks.  
The increase in outmigration that followed the  start of the economic transition in Myanmar has amplified  this trend. 
Post-Disaster Social Impacts  in the Literature 
And most importantly, it was clear that there  were many factors determining the pace of a village’s recovery and that the interplay between those factors resulted in  many possible outcomes. 
A smaller number of laborers  are often hired seasonally to assist with land preparation or crop care while the paddy is growing.
Fishers broadly reported that increased prices and dimin ished yield offset one another, and the net effect is that  returns of fishing have been essentially flat in recent years.
And yet, out migration has offered important opportunities for employ ment that lessen the exposure in terms of income.

Prawn catches were reported to have  recovered back to 2010 levels, though catches for most  types of fish remain a fraction of what they were before  Nargis.
For lesser quality paddy  varieties the price difference is less pronounced as brokers  are less interested in storing these types.
The increasingly unpredict able weather pattern due to climate change would have  had similar effects on flooding, though these would have  been lessened had the embankments and vegetation  remained in place.

As part of its comprehensive monitoring system and to  ensure it responded to the changing needs of Nargis affected communities, the Tripartite Core Group developed  the Post-Nargis Social Impacts Monitoring (SIM) project.
Despite these issues, some of which are found in almost all  villages, social cohesion remains strong.

It also complicated the aid  effort and slowed recovery.  
The poor socio economic outcomes are partly a reflection of the economic  infrastructure and geography of the region. 
This links back  to the post-Nargis period when the broader Christian community in Myanmar provided aid only to the villages’ Chris tian households.  
Over the past  five years, debt levels have continued to rise, though these  increases have been unevenly distributed among livelihood  groups.
Casual laborers’ debt levels are also up substantially, though  this likely reflects the greater access to credit available to  them in 2017 as much as needing to borrow for consumption.

SIM 4 found casual laborers facing a dire situation. While  in the immediate aftermath of Nargis, food aid had meant  that laborers faced reduced food insecurity, in the medium term agriculture’s stagnation and lack of secondary livelihood opportunities were placing an increasing strain on  laborer households.
Relations across the Village 
The 2015 local elec tions further consolidated this influence, and village tract  administrators (VTAs) have an increasingly strong grip.
In SIM 5, however, when asked what infrastructure their vil lage still needed, embankments were clearly a higher prior ity than in the past.
The by-product of resilience also exists at the community  level.

A comparison of highly and lightly affected villages helps  to pinpoint some noteworthy patterns.
The member households contribute a fixed amount ranging  from K500 to K1,000 monthly depending on their economic standing.
A village in Bogale township, where most households are farmers, was moderately affected by Nargis.

Initially, the degree of affectedness by Nargis was measured  by the number of people who died during the cyclone.43 
The cyclone-affected townships in the Ayeyarwady  region fare even worse than the region’s average.
If people could not break  out of the Nargis debt trap, there was also a risk of longer  term redistribution of assets from many to a few.
In many cases,  the ability of the village to gain improved infrastructure, be  included in government programs (the Evergreen program  is a notable example) and other benefits that come from 40 Meandering to Recovery: Post-Nargis Social Impacts Monitoring Ten Years After beyond the village, is based on the leader’s ability to net work, and willingness to volunteer their time and incur the  financial costs of engaging at the township.

The lack of rain in the  Delta outside of monsoon means that many communities  face water shortages in April and May, challenges that  have worsened in recent years due to shorter (albeit more  intense) monsoon periods.
At the same time, however, villagers had less time and fewer  resources for social interaction.

Alongside their contributions to a house hold’s main income, be it fishing or farming, women are  also often responsible for the day-to-day management of a  secondary income source—whether a small grocery shop, a  snack shop selling mohinga or, in larger villages, a more fully  stocked grocery store.
While there is  some overlap, households clearly operate as a more consoli dated and tighter unit with more of a focus on the individual  socio-economy compared to a village’s focus on local infra structure and social ties.  
With research in July and August 2017, SIM 5 returned to  these questions, looking back over the nine years follow ing Nargis’ devastation to understand how villages have  changed—and evaluating to what extent that change is  directly due to Nargis, indirectly related to Nargis, or reflects  other, broader, transformations in Myanmar.

A quarter of SIM villages  had experienced a high number of land transactions between  2010 and 2013, including half of the highly affected villages,  with further consolidation on the horizon: many farmers told  researchers they planned to sell their land once it had been  registered under the 2012 Farmland law.

As development actors look to develop longer term sustain able programming, the Delta’s current context is instructive  and provides lessons for the national government, donors,  and implementation agencies alike.

From 2013 to 2015, the fish catch was good because of the new net.  
SIM also confirmed that  good relations of local leaders with township leaders helped  mobilize additional resources for their communities. 
In some cases, village tract  administrators have set up schemes that provide farmers  with a way to remain current, but at a cost: the Village Tract  Administrator (VTA) (or a wealthy businessman using the  VTA as a middleman) provides a lump sum to the farmers  to repay MADB; shortly thereafter, farmers re-borrow from  MADB and pay back the VTA, plus a 5–6 percent service fee.

This development deficit is not a result of Nargis;  however, available data indicate high rates of poverty in this  area (relative to other regions and states) years before the  cyclone.
Furthermore, poor people are often exposed to frequent, low-intensity events, such as the recurrent floods. In  this sense, disasters not only increase the short-term eco nomic and social vulnerability of the poor, but also erode  their ability to cope with future shocks.

Identifying where a household or community is exposed to disaster and taking action to limit it are  the first components for reducing disaster impact.  
25 Villages were defined as “left behind” if at least two types of  infrastructure (housing, schools, water/sanitation, health) were  identified as either of poor quality or nonexistent.   
While considerable research has been undertaken on com munity resilience to natural disasters more broadly, the  literature on the long-term social impacts of a natural disas ter is limited.31 
Exact figures are not reported, but fishers, village leaders,  and the research team itself all reported that there has been  a notable decline in the number of households that have  fishing as the primary livelihood.
The challenges of  paying for labor are such that farmers of all sizes have begun  to seek alternatives that reduce their reliance on workers,  even if they require larger investments.
The social impacts  monitoring team represented a mix of Myanmar’s ethnic  and religious groups. 
The provision of immediate, life-sustaining aid must clearly  be the primary concern of any aid response to a disaster.  At the same, transparency, accountability, and participa tion ought to be central features of aid even at this stage.

As a longitudinal study over nine years in a panel of disaster affected villages, the Post-Nargis Social Impacts Monitoring  is an important contribution to the field of post-disaster  impacts analysis.
Research amply shows that remittances after a disaster play  an important part in a household’s ability to recover.

For those that remain, there has been an increase in the  number of women included in their leadership.
This reflected how villages that had been badly  damaged by Nargis had been unable to recover to pre-Nargis levels.
Fishing villages along or near the coastline  reported better catch levels than those set on the banks of  rivers forming the Ayeyarwady Delta.
Second, there are the specific steps that can be taken to reduce the  effects of a disaster when it does occur through planning  and preparation. 
Moderately affected 
Villagers who were well  qualified to lead the community had little interest, as they  thought it more important to focus on their own livelihoods  and businesses, while those who were willing to run for  the position often lacked management and communication  skills, had less influence in the community than those they replaced, and did not have the beyond-village network that  remains a key determinant of government support a village  will receive.  
Those who survived had to carry the additional  burden of lost male family members which, given rural  Myanmar’s traditional distribution of intra-household roles,  arguably put a greater strain on them as compared to sur viving widowers (who could also remarry more easily).

Less flood-prone land situated  near an access route could fetch five times the price of low  quality land.  
Within villages, sampling protocols were the same as for  SIM 1–4. The research team sought to interview a wide  cross-section of the community. This included: the village  head and other official village leaders; village elders and  religious leaders; others who were involved in aid decisions in the village; farmers, fishers, laborers, and those in other occupations; (potentially) vulnerable groups, includ ing female- headed households, the handicapped or injured,  and the elderly; and young men and women.

SIM 4  affirmed the relevance post-disaster social analysis but also  pointed out some challenges to doing good social analysis in  post-disaster settings, notably time (in the immediate post disaster period) and local research capacity (particularly in  countries with weak capacities).

He also borrowed a boat from a fisherman, but this meant that for every four  times other fishers went out, he could only go out once.

Location is a critical determinant of vul nerability, as is the quality of the built environment, includ ing infrastructure and housing. 
By 2009–2010, the ability of households, regardless of affectedness to  recover via migration and credit (even if expensive), is clear.  
For these activities, larger farmers often hire sea sonal or permanent laborers who are paid either monthly or for the whole season.

This picture  in turn seeks to help national and international policy makers and aid practitioners identify what is most important to  help communities prepare for shocks, recover from them,  and build the capacity to lessen the impact of such shocks  in the future.  
The SIM findings  over time confirm the original hypothesis, namely that continued monitoring of the socioeconomic activities and social  relations is critical to devising recovery (and later develop ment) assistance that meets the prevailing yet changing  needs of the disaster-affected population. 
A further four villages had taken  steps to cut down trees around the village, as homes had  been destroyed in previous storms when the trees were  blown down.  
In terms of post disaster assistance, this puts a premium on targeting, and  again underlines the usefulness of SIM to track household  status over time in a participatory manner.

•  Have households and the villages overall returned to the  pre-disaster situation in terms of social and economic  standing? Are they better off today than before Nargis? 
This also meant that  recovery aid did not aim to address structural constraints  and policies governing development in the Delta. 
Had  Nargis not happened, villagers would have been better able  to cope with subsequent natural events. 
•  The cyclone damaged embankments, mangrove forests,  and other vegetation, which led to more frequent flooding and saltwater intrusion. 
Small farmers were  found to be the most affected by increased indebtedness,  followed by laborers who frequently had to borrow for con sumption and, therefore, were greatly affected by increases  in prices for food and other necessities.

•  What is the quality of housing in the village? 
A recent study found that workers from the Ayeyarwady  region account for 29 percent of garment sector workers  in Yangon,11 while a World Bank survey in 2015 found that  20 percent of Delta households had at least one household member who had migrated (18 percent domestically, 2 per cent internationally).
In both cases, despite all respondents  reporting no major challenges to local social harmony,  there were more frequent reports of tension between the  groups.

A more individualistic way has emerged which  became quite pronounced five years after the cyclone, when  many families could no longer afford to attend community  social events. 
SIM clearly demonstrates that recovery is a dynamic process  that evolves over time in response to a myriad of external influences subsequent to the initial disaster. 
Even lightly affected villages  are in their majority not adequately prepared. 
While there is some overlap between household and community factors, there are also key differences, particularly surrounding  social relations and leadership.

tices, though there are clearly conflict of interest issues at  play.
Instead of providing affordable finance to help  people escape the debt trap, these loans are worsening the  debit situation of the Delta’s most vulnerable households  and have led some individuals and households to flee their  village in order to escape debt.
This was a veritable challenge.39 
2 Economic standing is defined as: ”good,” a notable increase in  remittance levels and local job opportunities, i.e., most households  have multiple working family members and few households in the  village have high levels of debt; “fair,” most households have at  least one regular income-generation activity (i.e., a daily income), i.e., there is a medium level of migration compared to other villages, and easy access to microfinance to invest in income-generatingactivities; “poor,” few local job opportunities exist, villages with  many households without multiple working family members, and  limited access to credit meaning high daily interest rates.
In general, informal leaders maintain good relationships  with formal leaders and hold different spheres of direct  influence. 
Since 2010, Myanmar has undergone major political, social, and economic changes.

Further, within the context of Ayeyar wady Delta villages, all these activities happen at both the  household and community levels.

Prices of everything we buy  are increasing and it is not good to depend on farming only.”
The variation in yield is shown in Table 6, and  Table 8 shows the best and worst prices large and small farmers have received for both monsoon and summer har vests since Nargis, as well as the spread between them.
Using SIM’s longitudinal data and its field experience, the  research team identified a variety of factors that contrib uted to the economic and social recovery of households and  communities over time.

Impact of migration
First, there are the cases, five  during the most recent local elections, where the previous  leader voluntarily vacated the position.

In some villages, there was an  increasing number of households taking on debt to improve  or rebuild their home.

In the years following the cyclone, there was the  immediate need to reinvest to replace lost boats, engines, and nets.
Villagers came together to raise funds,  especially in the case of funerals or hospitalizations.
Sellers
These criteria were hypothesized to affect recovery. 
The differences in  debt, leadership, and connectivity contribute to a marked  difference regarding recovery, with lightly affected villages much more recovered than highly affected ones.
Women also participate in repairing nets.
Some farmers reported that they now sell  their paddy harvest directly to brokers in town rather than  waiting for them to come to the farm gate.  
But as  they lived in different parts of the village, sharing of farming  equipment or the hiring of laborers from the other religion  was uncommon.
A large majority of research respondents reported that their  houses are now of better quality than before Nargis, and that  in recent years they have worked to improve them. 
Affectedness
While a counterfactual scenario cannot be established, a  comparison of highly and lightly affected villages helps to  pinpoint some noteworthy patterns. 
Note: The codes are: “1” enough capacity for recovery; “2“ some capacity  for recovery; “3” little capacity for recovery.

Second, they need to develop a  strong relationship with outside actors—higher levels of gov ernment and aid providers—to gain resources for recovery. 
While the  first objective for families with remittance income is a better ability to cope with daily basic needs, when remittances  reach a certain level, the family members who remain in the  village turn to opportunities, investing in income generating  activities, buying land, and making housing improvement.  
As a result, in many post-disaster situ ations, aid providers aim to strengthen community capacity  to plan and prepare for a possible future disaster. 
Livelihoods
Farmers went to great lengths to remain current  on at least their interest payments and were selling assets  other than land in order to do so. The story of debt in the  Delta two years after Nargis was thus one of continued asset  depletion but not yet of widespread default.
However, social interaction and  village cooperation have changed, reflecting the broader  trends identified above.

For the farmer, this is meant to  ensure that labor will be available, while for the laborer it  provides cash up front at what otherwise is a low season  for agricultural jobs. 
Microfinance was also criticized by villages for not offering  enough credit to substantially alter a household’s economic  trajectory.
Increased debt levels  also reflect the significant increases in credit available  within the village.

Villages in a Debt Trap
While there  has been significant investment in infrastructure from both  government and donors since Nargis, SIM villages continue to face major constraints. 
Programs that fail to take into account the roles of unpre dictable weather conditions, varied monsoon periods, dry  season droughts, increased storm frequency, and higher sea  levels will fail to deliver positive and sustainable results to  the communities they work with. 
This expansion of credit access since earlier rounds of SIM,  thanks to a mix of national and international NGOs, and government programs, has offered villagers the opportu nity to begin comparing different credit sources and make  decisions on which source best suits their needs.
For instance, two years after Nargis, laborers found  themselves in the direst predicament, yet seven years later  they were overall the most recovered livelihood group.

Land buyers tended to come from within the village itself,  and many were moneylenders, highlighting the challenge  of debt facing small and medium farmers.
For most local leaders, attending the monthly township  meeting was the total of engagement with the township  administration—and leaders from more remote communities  struggled even to attend these. 
This body, literally known as the Village Elderly  and Respected Persons committee, was tasked with setting  up, supervising, and monitoring the VTA election process.  
Case Study 7: Instances of Religious Tension
On May 2, 2008, Cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar’s Ayeyar wady Delta and swept across the region toward Yangon.
In this village, while in a minority, the Muslim community tends to own more land than the Buddhists and  are wealthier. 
As the SIM series indicates with regard to aid, emphasis  on the “what”—diverse economic activities, good quality  infrastructure—tended to overlook important “soft” factors  of recovery, the “how”—leadership, social network support,  and joint activities. 
This migration, and the remittances it brought, helped  those who stayed behind to recover.

Village leaders complained it is now very difficult to orga nize such a meeting if there was no incentive for villagers to  attend—for instance, the promise of outside assistance.
Over the following two years, three rounds of SIM were com pleted under the auspices of the Tripartite Core Group.

Lives  are lost or torn apart, homes and village infrastructure are  devastated, and both individual and community assets are  damaged, in some cases beyond repair.
These new institutions were also credited by villag ers as helping give rise to the potential for increased female  leadership locally as they require the inclusion of women in  their committee structures.
Inter-household  assistance is generally asked from and provided to only  people from the same religious group, though this has been  the case historically.
An estimated  140,000 people died in the storm, while damages and losses  from the destruction are estimated at around US$4 billion.
However, farmers regularly complain that disbursement comes late.
