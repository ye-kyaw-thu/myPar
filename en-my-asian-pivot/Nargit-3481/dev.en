Going into debt to finance home construction is increasingly  common, though households mostly reported that such debt  was manageable. 
Community leaders organize far fewer village meetings than  before 2013, a change attributed to a lack of villager interest.

In terms of the “what,” for exam ple, an oversupply of fishing boats in Aceh after the 2004  tsunami put added pressure on fish stocks that had been  declining prior to the disaster and increased preexisting  vulnerabilities.

Of the 18 SIM villages where the team was able to  evaluate the condition of fishing, 9 eight were highly affected (of twelve highly affected villages overall) while just two  were lightly affected (of ten).

There is more  female migration than male migration thanks to the develop ment of the garment industry in Yangon.
Poor standing
Since 2012 legislation that reshaped local governance took  effect, administrative influence has become increasingly  concentrated at the village tract level.
For both,  this likely also reflects the limited connectivity and oppor tunities (for either economic migration or improved prices)  in pre-reform Myanmar and the rapid change on both fronts  that has occurred over the past five years.  
Migration, national political change, a fraying of  the tight-knit social bonds that tied village groups together, and the introduction of local, albeit indirect, democracy, all  affected social relations within SIM villages.

Post-disaster migration can alter gender roles in the  affected communities as well, with women more involved  in paid work outside the home and community than before  the event.

Villagers in over one-third of the villages were caught in  a debt trap, unable to repay even the debts that they had  owed from before Nargis.
SIM 5 included the focus areas of the previous rounds of  research while adding new focus areas seeking to capture the  long-term or permanent effects from Nargis and subsequent  events and how villages have responded to the changed  context. 
There are new examples across the panel villages of associations that are developing social security funds.
Borrowing against the value of land has a long history in  the Delta.

The VTA does not  collect funds from the other village administrators, which villagers consider unfair. 
Until the opening of the  credit market in the Delta several years after the disaster,  households had to pay usurious interest rates of up to  50  percent per month. 
U Mg Mg is able to save K10,000 per day from these two livelihoods.
An exception to this model is in the case of  villages where the VTA lives or villages that are close to a  VTA’s home.
Reliance on neighbors starting to shift
The predominant  nonpeak activities tend to be preparation before planting  (including rebuilding paddy walls and irrigation channels)  and the weeding and crop care that takes place before the  harvest.
Conversely, for fishing licenses,  the situation nine years after Nargis is arguably worse than  it had been before the cyclone.

Other activities identified by the SIM  team as contributing to income diversification and mainly  organized by women included livestock raising, clothes  making/tailoring, supplementary agricultural labor, and  working as local fish collectors/brokers.
It is not possible to offer an accurate answer  to this question for a variety of reasons.
PACT provides  various forms of social assistance based on an assessment  of village needs.
In previous SIM reports, credit access was  limited, particularly for landless households seeking afford able (i.e., non-private moneylender) loans.
Furthermore, aid providers continued to make  aid-related decisions themselves, and aid distribution was  formalized through official leaders and village emergency  committees that were established for the purpose of distributing aid.
The  research team comprised Su Su Hlaing, Phyo Thitsar Kyaw,  Yi Monn Soe, and Thaw Zin (research supervisors) and War  War Lwin, Myo Thu Htun, Zay Yar Phyo, Soe Thiha, Saw Aung  Thein Myint, Noe Noe Nwe Lin, Khine Zin Yu Aung, Maung  Phyoe, Thaw Zay Thwin, Shwe Yamin Oo, K Zin Thaw, Naw  Htee Eh Hsoe, May Myat Noe Aye, and Aye Thandar Kyaw  (associate researchers).

According to both farmers and laborers, labor groups repre sent an improvement over individual hiring.
Once the catch is landed, women  sort the fish into categories and determine which will be  sold, which will be eaten by the household, and which will  be processed (either for consumption, sale as fish paste, or  used as bait).
Adding a small business or having a  migrant family member working in Yangon lessened the risk  that any one shock could wipe out their assets and income.
•  Second, while the initial sampling aimed to include four  unaffected control villages, it became apparent during  SIM 1 research that these had been struck by Nargis  as well.33 
Improved connectivity has enabled labor groups to orga nize more easily and access employment opportunities in  other villages, eased resupply for shopkeepers, and given  local brokers (especially fish brokers) access to new markets  including Yangon. 
Laborers received food aid  but less livelihood support compared to other groups. As  a result, many were facing immense difficulties in getting  by.

There were 15 villages where this was  reported as having happened at least once.
First, in-depth interviews were conducted with a wide  range of elite and non-elite villagers. 
All individuals can access Cooperative  Loans and Evergreen program finance (reflective of the  rules set up by the local committee) while PACT and other  microfinance and revolving fund programs actively enable  women to borrow independently of their husbands by setting up women’s groups for this purpose.
Again, communities reported that enthusiasm  for such events remains, but the ability for a village to hold  them and for villagers to participate is more limited.

The findings at the community level are more balanced  between economic and social factors than at the household  level, especially in the shorter term. 
Both villagers and 100 household heads also reported reduced ability to organize the villages for local collective  works or joint village activities. 
The new VTA wanted loans from the  scheme to be accessible to all villages in the tract.

But it was after the 2010 election and  the installation of the reform-minded government under  U Thein Sein in 2011 that changes to leadership within and  beyond the village really began to evolve as new government  services were delivered and democratic reforms introduced.

However, even as the process of recovery inched forward,  villagers have had to contend with new and diverse shocks  and changes that have both enabled and slowed their efforts  to rebuild.
In the twenty-first  century, these effects are seen all over the world, seared into  the consciousness of humanity.

The SIM 4 research found that economic strains were lead ing to more land transactions, resulting in increasing land  inequality where significant amounts of farmland were held  by a small number of individuals.
It  also looked at how the differing vulnerabilities across the  panel (as indicated by subsequent disasters) has affected  households’ and communities’ ability to recover.  
Further, as Bamar Buddhists could more  easily move to Yangon, they had higher migration rates,  while Muslim farmers took care to provide job security in  the village for their co-religionists.
With the help of their village  tract administrator, farmers created fake Land Use Certificates to ensure they could access loans.

However, despite its immense shock,  social relations and local capacity remained strong.
Less reliant on additional inputs than the  second summer season, the monsoon harvest also has higher  prices and is the traditional primary crop for most farmers.
Identifying where exposure can be reduced or protection is  needed is just the first step toward reducing the impact of a  disaster.

Many interviewees cited the inflexibility of microfinance  credit as a major issue; villagers frequently criticized the  requirement that borrowers make repayments every two  weeks.
The first monsoon peak season occurs in  May and June and involves the planting and transplantation  of paddy seedlings.
In 2017, some of  the most frequent requests were to borrow a motorcycle as  transport to visit a health clinic or borrow an identity card  (as national identity cards are far from ubiquitous in Nargis affected villages) which is needed when trying to register  with employers in Yangon or elsewhere.
At the same time,  there were no labor sharing and few areas of joint decision  making as the two groups largely live separately.

For women  who return to the village, they often bring back both hard  skills and a new outlook on life enabling them to identify  needs in the village and set up businesses to address those  needs.
Tensions over distribution persisted into SIM 4, albeit at  lower levels as by 2013, social challenges were more directly  linked to economic ones.
Awareness of a community’s history and  the ability to learn from successes and failures of the past  are other important ingredients of resilience. And, the larger  the number of resilient households within the community is,  the more resilient is the community. 
These methods are illegal, but remain  common practice, and have been applied more frequently  since Nargis.
Nargis destroyed his nets and boat.
Based on this  analysis, the joint assessment report included in its guiding  principles the need to involve communities at all stages of  the relief process, including decision making and feedback  on the quality of the relief and recovery effort; maximizing  the use of local initiative, resources, and capacities; and  building the capacity of local communities to participate in  the relief and recovery effort.
 The expansion of larger scale fishing enterprises based gen erally at the township level has contributed to this decline.
Moreover, in the rush  to provide support immediately after the cyclone, providers  distributed aid that was ill suited to the Ayeyarwady Delta’s  climate and ecology, including with regard to shelter and  farming inputs. 
Aware ness of gender issues has also increased, especially among  SIM’s female respondents who reported they had more  information on issues such as violence against women18 and  concerns over human trafficking.
It examined both issues of preparedness, i.e., the  extent to which communities in the Delta take explicit  actions in expectation of another cyclone or a drought, and  how the socio-economy of these communities has changed  in efforts to adapt to a post-Nargis context.  
Though difficult to distinguish in detail, it is also evident  that higher order losses, those caused by impacts that were  themselves caused by the direct effects of Nargis, have cast  a long shadow on the recovery of villages in the Delta. 
At the community level, diversified economic  activities within the village, credit access, leadership and  social networks, good infrastructure, and external assis tance were the factors most important for recovery.  
While these are large-scale investments, there are other  examples available to more households where the by product of a decision or economic activity is improved  household resilience.

Farmers  are also now more likely to plant more paddy seedlings than  previously necessary in anticipation of the need to replant.

In so  doing, they would reduce many of the vulnerabilities Delta  villages continue to suffer from. 
A particular challenge is that disasters lead to greater debt,  and not only of the poor.
Youth participation in all forms of village activities is down,  primarily due to migration.
The Cooperative Department’s loan scheme offers varying  amounts to all livelihood groups, and has become more  popular among villagers, though some still object to its  forced savings mechanisms.

In these  villages, those households that could afford it invested in  homes or property outside the village.

In hazards research, resilience incorporates the capacity  to reduce or avoid losses, contains the effects of disasters,  and recovers with minimal disruptions. 
Villages Able to Settle Their Loans Regularly
The momentum that these programs have created can and  should be used to make community-based disaster risk  management (CBDRM) a standard feature of any local level  project. 
Debt continued to undermine the prospects for recovery.
Without the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and  Recovery, post-Nargis social impacts monitoring would not  have been possible; it financed field research of four out of  five rounds, including this round 5.
The longer recovery takes, the stron ger the impacts of indirect effects of the original event and/ or new hazards and developments.

Over time, disaster related debt can lead to a more inequitable distribution of land.

In other villages, farmers have realized that MADB’s enforce ment is piecemeal or completely absent and simply failed  to repay their loans.
In 2017, however, while SIM villages  are at a high risk of another rapid onset disaster, they also  face an almost certain slow onset disaster in the form of  climate change (see box below). 
By 2016, the fish catch had declined, a problem he attributed to weather variation, and the fisher decided to get a new  “Kyar” net.
For example, in  one village the minority Muslim population expressed their  willingness to contribute funds for improvements to the  local monastery as it is used as the local shelter.

The purchase of agricultural machinery, especially larger  machines, also has a multiplier effect, as such equipment is  often rented out to other villagers, reducing labor costs for  other farmers while helping the owners recoup their invest ment more rapidly.

In some villages, every fisher lost all their livelihood equipment and was forced to start from scratch.

Their formal duties  have an emphasis on local administration, and they are also  responsible for engagement with township-level authorities  and development of the village tract. 
Factors of a more social nature generally scored as less  important, perhaps because relations were strong and could  be relied on. 
Trust in  the other religious group was undercut due to aid and,  with that mistrust strengthened by broader forces around  religious nationalist and ethnic identity across Myanmar,  these divides have remained. 
However, while several hundred thousand  kyat, the most offered by many of the microfinance services,  can finance extra fertilizer for a farmer or a new motorcycle  for a taxi service, loans of this size do not allow for livelihood transformation.

These debts are having  further effects on the social relations of the communities,  examined in more detail in the following chapter.
Communities and  people who are more resilient are better able to cope with  and recover from the consequences of disasters that can not be avoided. 
In addition, women face entrenched societal barriers to  participation: they are often poorly represented in decision  making and in project planning, implementation, and moni toring.

Such disagreements often revolve around issues of  public nuisance (generally related to alcohol abuse), small scale debt repayment issues, disagreements over advance  payments to agricultural laborers, and conflict between the  livelihood groups.
Also experi encing a decline were disaster risk reduction committees,  now present in just four villages across SIM, reflecting both  the lack of young people who had traditionally been active  in these committees and the fact that most villages have  not experienced a major storm in recent years and see little  urgency for disaster risk management activities.

Moreover, some farmers and fishers themselves became casual laborers, so competition increased for the jobs that did exist.

However, in practice farmers face dif ficulties enforcing the informal contract with laborers not  showing up or demanding additional wages.
Winds from the south that accompanied the hilsa fishing season have been replaced by  northerly breezes, and they have been accompanied by a decline in the size of fish that can be caught.

Until recent years, these farmers borrowed from one government  source, the Myanmar Agricultural Development Bank, and  a range of local private money lenders (including village or  townships traders, fertilizer shops, and larger farmers).
When land rights are purchased, the purchaser tends  to be larger farmers within the village or from a neighboring village, though researchers found a notable increase in land less households (generally young couples or households  with remittance income) seeking to invest in land for the  first time.
Activity-based groups
In a small number of communities particularly badly affected  by Nargis, villagers reported that they were reluctant to  invest in improved housing, as a future storm would simply  destroy the houses. 
Such new techniques, quite  apart from any effect on the harvest, have negative environ mental impacts, affecting water quality in local streams and  rivers as well as fish stocks.

While farmers reported mixed results from all three types of  actors, improved seed was recognized as an important first  step, as was improved knowledge on how much fertilizer to  apply and when.  
Interviewees across villages reported that their views on  what was required from a good leader had evolved in recent  years and since the election; however, this is not reflected  in the identity of their leaders following the 2015 local  elections.

Migration has also played a role: DRR com mittees were often run by the younger generation, many of  whom have since left the village.

Agricultural labor

As highlighted in the discussion on livelihoods, agricultural  labor groups are more common than ever before and in two  villages nonagriculture labor groups have also started up.
As a result, highly affected villages  today seem to work together for all kinds of development  activities more effectively than less affected villages.
There  was also a significant difference between the worst-hit  townships along the coast—Labutta, Bogale, Pyapon, Kung yangon, and Dedaye—where farming conditions were mostly  poor, and communities in townships were further inland.
The primary livelihood in a village in Bogale township is fishing; there are only a few farming households.
Examples from the SIM research  include the motorcycle taxi used for evacuation, building a  new home out of concrete because of the increase in wood  prices resulting in improved home sturdiness, and the pur chase of a satellite dish for entertainment that is now used to  view weather forecasts and improve information awareness.

Today,  the fishing context requires a boat with an engine—a large  expense that most village-level credit sources (including  microfinance providers) are ill-equipped to address.
As a result, many farmers faced a debt trap.
In these, researchers made efforts to deter mine why the individual or household had done worse or  better than others.

It looks at the three main live lihood groups (farmers, fishers, and landless laborers)  and at key issues such as debt, land, and housing and  local infrastructure.  
Nonetheless, SIM 4 found that  overall, social relations remained strong.
Debt in itself is also not related to Nargis, as it has been  the lubricant of the local economy for generations. 
Women who have  migrated are more able to identify economic opportunities  in the village when they return, and have sought to take  advantage of village needs.
Migration is a contributing factor to the decline in socio religious occasions celebrated in many villages.
The role of women and youth continued to evolve.
Initiatives such as  DRR committees have disappeared as donors have moved  on, and most communities would rather invest in religious  buildings or paddy storage facilities than a purpose-built  cyclone shelter.

As  shown in Table 6, the difference between a good harvest’s  yield and a poor one is significant, with yields collapsing  almost 50 percent.
There is little difference in  credit access between highly and moderately affected vil lages, with lightly affected villages having on average about  one additional credit source (Figure 2).
But the experiences of house holds across the SIM panel show that those who were pre pared; who knew to store rice, water, oil, and documents;  who knew to evacuate from their vulnerable village; and  who had access to radio warnings fared better than those  who did not. 
After the first year after  Nargis, their livelihood has received less support compared  to farming,30 even as the regulatory and competitive land 
On the one hand, these have  started to overshadow the direct effects of Nargis. 
Sadly, this is a common outcome of  any major natural disaster.
The survival of economic  assets, availability of jobs, management of resources, availability of affordable credit, and number of family members  fit and able to work were all identified as very important to  household recovery in the years immediately following Nar gis. 
SIM was the first time that the social impacts of a  natural disaster had been assessed periodically as a core  part of a post-disaster needs assessment and formal monitoring system. 
Each research team spent  approximately three days in each village, with additional  time allocated for travel.  
This is an indicative rather than definitive map, but  helps illustrate that while households may continue to have  a primary livelihood, in reality most seek diverse sources of  income across a twelve-month period.

Good relations with family, the importance of  having a male household head, and the ability to be entrepreneurial were all seen as moderately important in the  early stages of disaster recovery.  
Alongside service  expansion came new legislation, massive improvements in connectivity (particularly technology but also for transportation infrastructure), and both a level of increased asser tiveness on the part of villagers and a reduced ability of  local leaders to engage in local authoritarianism.

In the coming years, it is a question of when rather than if  the Delta will experience major flooding, and planning by  development actors should account for this uncertain future.  
There is little social interaction  between the two groups on any issues and they do not invite  the other group to religious or other events.
Despite restrictions on  migration during the time of the military regime, household  members migrated to Yangon after the cyclone in search of  work.

Villagers, however,  were also asked to reflect on the nine years since Nargis  and on how their household and their village had recovered,  as well as what steps they had taken (again, at both house hold and community levels) to prepare themselves for future  disasters. 
Action is then taken: both longer term planning for  households and communities in the event of a disaster and  immediate preparation steps when it becomes apparent that  a rapid onset disaster is imminent.

Women, within both male- and female-headed households,  have made particularly important contributions to a household’s ability to diversify incomes via nonagricultural jobs (Case Study 4).
In the immediate aftermath of Nargis there are wide range  of important factors that determined a household’s ability to  recover and the bulk of those that scored as very important  (i.e., ‘1’) were livelihood-centric. 
Further,  land disputes, which were a major theme and potential risk highlighted in SIM 4, were found to have declined in both  number and severity.

By SIM 4, the focus of the research had come  to include the socioeconomic impacts of the disaster and aid  response, local social relations and institutions, and the sta tus of village infrastructure, much of which required repair  and reconstruction after Nargis.
