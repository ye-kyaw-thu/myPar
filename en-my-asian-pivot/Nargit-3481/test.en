These  village-directed groups sit alongside committees linked to  donor development programs which are now ubiquitous  across the Delta, and self-directed economic groups, such  as the agricultural labor groups, are now present in over a  quarter of villages. 
In some villages, larger farmers were also active land sellers, generally  driven by two factors.
•  What are people’s livelihood coping strategies today? 
Beyond a few large-scale challenges, such as embankments,  the development needs of communities across the Delta  tend to be local, and communities are best placed to identify  and design programs to address them. 
In  particularly vulnerable villages, households might visit rela tives in town until the storm has passed.  
Group membership 
Small farmer Ko Aung Tun owns two acres of paddy land and rents land from other farmers as well.
As Table 36 indicates, villages tended to have  some capacity for recovery with all factors, and credit was  identified as the one where enough was accessible to enable  recovery even if often at very high interest rates.

Early rounds of SIM examined the social strength of villages  in the Delta following Nargis and, in later rounds, the evolv ing effects of assistance and aid delivery on social bonds.
Moreover, they face an important deficit in social  networks—all important entry points for future aid. 
Total
Depending on  the weather, experience of flooding and pests, or quality of  the land, yields per acre for villages lightly affected by Nar gis have varied from 23 baskets per acre in the worst year of  the last five, to 55 baskets per acre in best year.  
However, it should  be noted that these measures have been taken within villages; there were no indications that any communities had  replanted mangroves or even viewed mangroves as useful  for flood or storm surge reduction. 
21 VTAs are supposed to receive a stipend from GAD plus allowances for the cost of their duties. However, the disbursement of this money  appears extremely varied across townships. 
Many of the persistent chal lenges identified by communities regarding local infra structure, access to finance, and livelihood diversification  could be at least partially addressed by such programs. 
Economic standing plays a key role in whether a leader can  be effective, largely because wealth is frequently a positive  influence when dealing with township authorities, peer col leagues, and villagers. 
It developed a set of hypotheses on forms of  social impact that might play out in the post-Nargis period.
Agricultural labor in the Delta region can be divided between  peak and non-peak employment.
Village leaders play an important role in the planning and  preparation for potential disasters. 
Two rounds of fieldwork were then conducted from July  to September, 2017. 
Fishers
The villagers reported women  have more ability to save money as they do not (have the  chance to) participate in social, entertainment, gambling, or  drinking.
In a small  number of communities highly affected by Nargis, villagers  reported that they did not see the point of rebuilding, as  a future Nargis-like storm would destroy them all.
So, for paddy sold at 6 lakh per  100 baskets, the price 2–3 months later could be anywhere  from 7 to 9 lakh per 100 baskets.

SIM 2 was undertaken one year after Nargis from  May to June 2009, while SIM 3 was completed by May 2010,  shortly before the Tripartite Core Group came to an end in  July 2010.
Both of these groups use a range of net sizes, generally working from small, uncovered motorboats with ‘fishtail’ propellers.
Their catch  tends to be larger fish and, as shown later in this chapter,  these fishers experience greater returns from fishing.

The literature indicates that aid reduces the impact of a  natural disaster. 
In turn, this indicates that  efforts to enable improved resilience must be focused as much on providing disadvantaged groups with a safety net  as on enabling the village or region as a whole to develop.  
A program to provide embank ments across the Delta would serve multiple purposes, from  improving agricultural returns, to providing a new livelihood  for landless laborers, to enhancing DRR.  
The passing away of religious leaders during Nargis contributed to strained social relations five years on, especially in  villages with both Muslims and Buddhists.

Fishers across the SIM panel  often attributed (anecdotally) declines in catches to water  pollution from agriculture.
For various fish types, these rules can range from a simple  K5,000 licenses for individual fishers to K2.5 million con cessions to large businesses which subcontract smaller fishing enterprises.

The Ayeyarwady River, its Delta, and the offshore waters  hold a wide variety of fish and seafood species.
The importance of migration to the Delta economy after  Nargis cannot be overemphasized. ၏

Township roads are  fully reliant on the government, with the exception of one  village where the community has collected money to help  advance the project.
First, there is the use of the Land Use Certificate as collat eral for loans from private sources.
Instead, extension services and agricultural trainings fall to  three groups.

First, improved market  access has reduced the number of middlemen for fishers in many villages.
Home improvements primarily meant improved materials,  though the research team also observed new designs in  anticipation of flooding or high winds. 
To the extent  possible, the researchers tried to get the perspectives on  the same topics from each group in order to triangulate the  information received.  
Numerous studies attest to the important role that lead ership plays for recovery. 
Disasters and vulnerability 
Among farmers, there are many who have struggled to  remain eligible for government loans while others have con sciously defaulted.

39 This dilemma is also revealed in the fact that 25 villages are con sidered recovered, but only eight are in good economic standing,  implying that the pre-Nargis standing to which they recovered had  not been good.

In 2013, mobile phones were virtually unheard of across  Myanmar, but in 2017 all villages had access to 3G services  and mobiles were ubiquitous across the panel.

The use  of poison, explosives, and car batteries in fishing (the for mer kills fish via the concussive force while the latter kills  via voltage) are indiscriminate and can damage river beds  and other animal life.
Several months later they  borrowed K700,000 at 5 percent interest per month from the brother-in-law from whom they had gotten the idea and  set up their shop.
In other words, though unquantifiable, Nargis left  a clear and lasting mark on the economic prospects of the  villages it destroyed.

Vulnerability is seen as the ability of an exposed population  to withstand a hazard and reduce its social, economic, and  personal impacts. 
SIM confirms the central place of local leadership in the  recovery process. Over time, good leadership combined with  increasing outmigration have been the central determinants  of whether or not a village recovered.

Prices for paddy harvest have increased as well, with SIM  panel farmers reporting an average price (per 100 baskets  of monsoon paddy) of K6.3 lakh,1 up from K3.7 lakh in 2013.
The two most commonly cited were increased competition from fishers from other places, including larger  fishing businesses from the township, and a perceived  decline in water quality.
The NLD  Member of Parliament attended, as did district- and township-level officers from the Department for Rural Development (DRD).
At the same time, fishers, while unable to effectively  address slower onset problems like water quality or  increased pollution, have been able to take steps to reduce  their own risk during rapid onset disasters.

No village reported receiving assistance from the  department unless it requested advice on a specific issue, such as one village which asked for help dealing with a snail infestation (an issue the department was unable to resolve).
Through  both a review of existing literature and fieldwork experience, the SIM research defines resilience as a household’s  or community’s ability to recover faster from a disaster and  reduce the impact of a disaster.26

Despite being the rice bowl of Myanmar, the Ayeyarwady  region has the third highest poverty rate in Myanmar; nearly  one in two individuals in the region could be considered  poor.
The limited sample  size notwithstanding, the evidence suggests that the post Nargis NGO efforts to reach the most affected communities  have been very important for recovery. 
Conversely, migration plays a critical role for house holds as it helps diversify income and makes households  less vulnerable to shocks.
Having a higher education is another  criterion for strong leadership, yet it falls behind wealth and  having a strong network.  
Nonetheless, social norms and pressures do factor into  women’s ability to access credit.

The higher costs of hiring labor have had particular negative  effects on medium farmers, who are less able to fall back on  family labor (the coping strategy of choice for smaller farm ers) and do not have the financial options of larger farm ers who can more easily access capital, choose to rent out  farmland, or even sell land to raise cash.

Villages continue to cooperate and work together at similar  levels and for similar goals, both before Nargis and in previ ous rounds of SIM research.
Women are more involved in local organizational activities  thanks to NGOs and development activities that have man dated a gender balance in committees and other aid-linked  development projects.
All but  three villages have their own school buildings (at least at  the primary level), but many are in poor condition as vil lages do not receive funds for maintenance.

Of the remaining 22 villages, 13 (59 percent) changed 100  household heads shortly after the election. 
Put another way, almost 80 per cent of villages have experienced substantial outmigration.
Contributing factors

Other changes, including the  evolution of market access, price changes, and especially Myanmar’s internal migration boom, which has in turn  affected labor availability, reflect broader shifts affecting  communities across the country.
The importance of MADB has led to a variety of coping strategies when harvests fail and farmers want to ensure they  remain eligible for future loans.
Directly observing dynamics and impacts also provided  much information on the way villages were functioning,  the interplay between the long-term effects of Nargis and  other disasters or exogenous effects on the village, and  how broader changes around Myanmar were felt at the village level.  
Aid appeared to be helping villages recover-there was a link between the amount of aid received and the  speed of recovery.
The common reasons behind the shifts in leadership can be  divided into two categories. 
Given the substantial population density of  the area, Ayeyarwady region is home to nearly one in five  of Myanmar’s poor—18 percent of the poor were estimated  to live in this region in 2009/10. 
By 2017, the negative social effects of Nargis and the aid  effort that followed were largely dispersed, replaced in most  villagers’ minds by the forces affecting social change across  Myanmar.

While not a traditional village-level livelihood, improved access and social networks in some villages have  meant that subsistence or small-scale fishers have increas ingly turned to employment on fishing boats to either supplement or replace their other livelihood.
Before Nargis the road that connected the village to the tract flooded regularly and villagers could only go by foot, with  water often up to their knees.

For future aid to the Ayeyarwady Delta, the importance of  climate change as a determinative factor of future activities  is clear.
38 An index of wealth was constructed using asset and demo graphic indicators from the 2014 Population and Housing Census.

Reductions in harvests were driving  increased debt burdens for farmers, many of whom could  not repay old loans and also had to borrow for consumption.
SIM confirms the importance of social capital for the recov ery of panel villages, though perhaps not to the extent of  being the “core engine of recovery.”

In sum, we can see that in the early recovery period follow ing a disaster, social ties bringing the village together to act and the ability to generate cash (whether through aid, diverse livelihood activities, or loans) were the key factors  for community recovery.

In response to flooding and its associated effects on farming  livelihoods, farmers across SIM villages perceive a need for  embankments that can withstand flooding and protect harvests.
Yet, nine years after Nargis just three villages reported hav ing improved water sources—defined as bore wells or other  direct access to ground water.  
Indirect elections via the 10 household heads for the posi tion of VTA were introduced in 2012.
