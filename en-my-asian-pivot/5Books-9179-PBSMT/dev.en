Villagers who were well  qualified to lead the community had little interest, as they  thought it more important to focus on their own livelihoods  and businesses, while those who were willing to run for  the position often lacked management and communication  skills, had less influence in the community than those they replaced, and did not have the beyond-village network that  remains a key determinant of government support a village  will receive.
