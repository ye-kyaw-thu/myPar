During the review process, committee members prepared revisions to the budget and submitted it to the Legislation  Committee for approval before discussion and approval at the hluttaw session.  
This positive picture for prices is, however, tempered by two issues.

Of the 18 SIM villages where the team was able to  evaluate the condition of fishing, 9 eight were highly affected (of twelve highly affected villages overall) while just two  were lightly affected (of ten).
In other words, the capacity of the survivors to  recover from a major disaster depended more on how many assets they had lost to the disaster than the number of lives  lost in the community. Consequently, SIM 4 used the fol lowing definitions, as assessed by villagers and researchers:

( d ) The Speaker of the Region or State Hluttaw shall form an investigation body and cause the charge to be investigated in accord with the law . 
The  effect of embankments is clear: of the twelve villages that currently have embankments, all but one reported that farm ing conditions in the village were good or fair, and all but  three were also considered recovered.

Previous SIM research found many households carried sig nificant levels of interest-bearing debt from a variety of  government-subsidized and private sources.
This involves turning a general idea into concrete goals or objectives, which are clearly stated.
Unlike in other parts of Myanmar where migrants tend to  skew male, the number of migrants out of SIM villages  are slightly more female.
While this appeared to be a common  and largely anodyne practice, there were cases where the  expense of a new home had driven households deeply into  debt.  
While  government support to the neediest has begun to increase,  communities continue to serve as the backbone of social protection.

In many cases, the ability of a parliamentarian to become knowledgeable about the range of possible issues and the quality of a parliamentarian’s response is vastly improved with the assistance of a parliamentary research service.
Response and assistance  generally follow rapidly, with the country’s own government,  international governments, and a vast range of nongovern mental and intergovernmental organizations working to  bring aid to affected communities.

Aid was important for the recovery process, and on the  whole, recovery has been stronger in villages that received  more aid. 
SIM 5 research found a somewhat more positive, if highly  variable, situation facing farmers where improving prices  and the possibility of good yields are regularly undermined  by weather shocks and poor quality harvests.

However, it is still extremely low by international standards – as of  25th September 2020, the IPU’s global database indicates that Myanmar ranks 167 out of 191  countries for the level of women’s representation in the national lower house.
A program to provide embank ments across the Delta would serve multiple purposes, from  improving agricultural returns, to providing a new livelihood  for landless laborers, to enhancing DRR.  
The limited experience of local ministries and departments in drafting bills constrained  and delayed the implementation of laws promulgated as rules and regulations. 
However, good rela tions between them facilitated recovery. Interestingly, vil lagers considered English language skills important for local  leaders, as this would enable them to engage more effec tively with external aid providers. 
Clearly knowing a target group, including their strengths and weaknesses, ensures training sessions meet their specific  goals and objectives (Training Scope).

However, as described below in Section 6, being a local leader, and especially a W/VTA, can be  expensive, and the knowledge of this is likely to deter some potential candidates. 
Qualitative data to support assessment
The areas that, according to local legisla tive members, lacked the most clarity were the  economy, local development activities and taxa tion. 
Section 4 described  various factors that contribute to the male dominance of political leadership positions in  Myanmar, with some of the most important being: women facing greater time constraints than men to become political leaders due to expectations around unpaid domestic work; limitations on women’s travel, especially at night time; and certain institutional features and historical legacies of Myanmar’s political system that tend to favour male leadership.

Respondents also stated that exchange visits between local legislatures were important support  mechanisms that increased the cooperation among hluttaws and allowed newly elected politicians to learn from one another.

A quarter of SIM villages  had experienced a high number of land transactions between  2010 and 2013, including half of the highly affected villages,  with further consolidation on the horizon: many farmers told  researchers they planned to sell their land once it had been  registered under the 2012 Farmland law.

In sum, we can see that in the early recovery period follow ing a disaster, social ties bringing the village together to act and the ability to generate cash (whether through aid, diverse livelihood activities, or loans) were the key factors  for community recovery. 
As a result, Parliamentary research services not only help find relevant and authoritative information quickly; they also make sense of the information through analysis.

Since  this conference, many countries have made concerted efforts to increase the number of women in politics, and for example, the percentage of the world’s parliamentarians that are  women has more than doubled, from 11% in 1995 to 25% in 2020.

The nature of opposition by family  members can be shaped by the gendered roles that males and females are expected to  perform in the family: four male interviewees specifically described their wife criticising them or arguing with them due them spending too long on community leadership activities at the  expenseoftheirbusiness/income-generating activities;butone female intervieweementioned her family being opposed to her becoming a 10 HH as they thought it would leave her with no  time for housework, and another female local leader said that she had been criticised for  neglecting her children so she can participate in her voluntary work. 
Aid providers continued to be the main decision makers, determining both the type of project and the process  of implementation.

A village in Bogale township, where most households are farmers, was moderately affected by Nargis.
Of these factors, debt is most closely related to Nargis, as the  cyclone broke the debt-harvest-repay cycle that had been  sustaining the main livelihood, farming, in the Delta.

The  physical requirements of fishing from a boat mean there are  few women-headed households who fish in this way, but  some do engage in subsistence fishing using small boats and  nets that do not require great strength, expensive licenses,  or the need to venture far from the village.

The literature abounds with examples of post-disaster aid  not being sufficiently gender sensitive.

Conversely, migration plays a critical role for house holds as it helps diversify income and makes households  less vulnerable to shocks.

Whether quotas within larger committees,  women-only bodies, or some other model, involving women  in decision making both gave them the tools and confidence  to put themselves forward and helped socialize men to the  idea of formal female leadership and women’s voices being  heard in social affairs, previously a rare occurrence in Myanmar village life.

Despite these common perceptions, however,  the study found that the speakers of the Mon  State and Sagaing Region Hluttaws, both of civilian background, maintain a mutually respect ful relationship with the executive officials who  were previously senior military members. When  asked about the leadership characteristics that  best foster diplomatic relations, respondents stated that previous experience, educational background, and, most importantly, the individual will  for change are the key characteristics of a strong and successful leader. Such characteristics  helped leaders succeed in leading their hluttaws to a measurable level of success, even in the  challenging context of a democratic transition (Please see Annex C. for the occupational background of hluttaw speakers and chief ministers and the relationships between legislative and ex ecutive officials). 
The areas where local legislative members  perceive the most confusion and conflict are the economy, local development activities and taxa tion. The ambiguity and confusion of legislative authority in the 2008 Constitution has hindered  local legislative efforts.
