In Buddhist-Muslim villages, the communities do  still attend each other’s major religious festivals, but they  live in de facto segregation, do not hire laborers from the other religious group, and rarely cooperate on village devel opment activities.
For example, since well before  Nargis, farming households would ask for labor sharing  help from other farmers when ploughing or planting their fields.
In the tenth year after the disaster,  the memories of Nargis have faded somewhat, and despite  regular flooding and the experience of smaller cyclones  in the past several years, the urgency to spend significant  time and money preparing for disasters is gone from all but  the villages worst affected by Nargis.

The particular  value added by SIM 5, however, is the longitudinal compari son over nine years across a panel of 40 villages, offering a unique window into the daily lives of villagers in an area  severely devastated by a major natural disaster well beyond  the timeframe of normal recovery assessments. 
The village was badly affected by the  cyclone, and in the following years many Bamar migrants  moved to the village because of the large amounts of outside  assistance the village received.

By focusing on a panel of 40 Nargis-affected villages across  time, five rounds of SIM have been able to track how village  life has changed both post-Nargis and, in more recent years,  as villagers faced both new challenges and continued recovery from Nargis.

In recent years, changes to license fees have accounted for  more and more of the ongoing costs for fishers.
One of the clearest risk reduction steps in SIM villages has  been the planting and/or removal of specific groups of trees  in the years following Nargis.

Based on existing lit erature and the experience of previous rounds of SIM, resil ience in the Delta was defined as the ability to both reduce  the impact of a disaster and recover more rapidly when a  disaster strikes.  
These laws are considered non-routine laws. 
While these are large-scale investments, there are other  examples available to more households where the by product of a decision or economic activity is improved  household resilience. 
Identifying where exposure can be reduced or protection is  needed is just the first step toward reducing the impact of a  disaster.

However,  the study also concluded that since the credibility of these data varied and the data were not comparable across studied hluttaws, it was difficult to determine the extent to which they reflect ed the actual effectiveness of local hluttaws. 
Regardless, these findings are still worth presenting in the final needs  assessment report and discussing with the parliamentary leadership.

Some female candidates  were clearly dependent on the financial support of husbands and relatives, and this was sometimes mentioned as a prerequisite for their political career. 
Two  critical ingredients to recovery and resilience that require  the attention of aid providers as well are social capital both  within and across communities and with the local adminis tration, and the quality and commitment of local leaders, both formal and informal.

The study found that only a few of the non-routine laws, notably  municipal laws and fishery laws, submitted by the state and region ministries were drafted by the  relevant administrative departments. Hluttaw legislation committees drafted the remaining  non-routine laws and turned them over to the respective ministry for official submission as a bill in  the hluttaw.  
Such disagreements often revolve around issues of  public nuisance (generally related to alcohol abuse), small scale debt repayment issues, disagreements over advance  payments to agricultural laborers, and conflict between the  livelihood groups.
The gender gap in people’s reported interest  in and confidence to participate in politics is much smaller than the gender gap we see in political leadership – for example, men are around 9 times more likely than women to be an  MP, and more than 100 times more likely than women to be a W/VTA.

Factors Driving Changes to Village Social Relations 
According to respondents  from the surveyed hluttaws, hluttaws formed these legislation committees to review and prepare  bills.7 
Their main responsibilities  are now to organize activities as directed by the VTA, such  as spreading information about MADB loans, collaborating  with the local midwife on a vaccination program for small  children, or very localized dispute resolution such as marital  disputes or fights between drunks.  
The long-term trend that SIM found, however, indicates that  while social relations within and between villages are still  good a decade after Nargis, they are less strong then they  used to be. 
Either in the town or, more frequently in recent  years, Yangon, it is possible for most able-bodied adults to  find work that allows them to live and send small amounts  of money back to their family.
They moved to Yangon in 2007 and started to work in a weaving factory where they were paid just K30,000 for the  first month.
Further, mandatory quotas could be  beneficially applied to committees at township, ward/village tract, and village levels – this approach has already been demonstrated by the NCDDP program.

If more women become MPs, local leaders, and senior party officials there will be more female role models for other women and girls to be inspired by, thereby  further contributing to making political participation more gender equal. 
Respondents from local  media felt more welcomed by the Tanintharyi Region Hluttaw and Mon State Hluttaw, measured by  increased invitation to hluttaw sessions and discussion. 
For women  who return to the village, they often bring back both hard  skills and a new outlook on life enabling them to identify  needs in the village and set up businesses to address those  needs.

Even when facing  significant debt burdens, these farmers continue to seek  innovative ways to retain their land and plant it, knowing  that one or two good harvests can allow them to escape the  debt trap, while the market value of the land will do little  but furnish consumption costs for a year or more.

The implications for laborers is that there are both  expanded opportunities to work for themselves rather than  for a business and that they have improved access to better  jobs in town rather than being restricted to opportunities  within their village.
In two of the studied hluttaws, Yangon Region Hluttaw and Shan State Hluttaw,  there were no external support groups assisting with legislation. Those commissions that do exist  are chaired by hluttaw speakers or deputy speakers and consisted of external resource personnel,  notably law professors, retired and practicing attorneys, legal and law enforcement officers, legal  advocates, and retired policy chiefs.

Table 20: Perceptions of Local Formal Leaders  by Degree of Affectedness 
Most respondents identified common factors that influence the effec tiveness of hluttaws. These factors include: 1) the perception that local legislatures are subordi nate to local executive authorities; 2) the ability for legislative members to take dual positions; and  3) the limited experience of legislative members. Although some of these issues were discussed in  the other sections of this report, they are discussed in detail in the following sections.

The leaders and MPs of studied hluttaws stated that the most effective means of receiving  information from and communicating with the communities they represent is through in-person  visits to their respective constituencies. 
This is more meaningful than indicating, e.g., how many respondents ranked 1, 2, or 3.

The study found that only a few non-routine  laws submitted by state and region ministries,  notably municipal laws and fishery laws, were  drafted by the relevant departments. There maining non-routine laws were drafted by hlut taw legislation committees and turned over to  the respective ministry to be officially submitted  as a bill in the respective hluttaw.

It can be surmised that the sample villages would still be  poor today without Cyclone Nargis, but that they would be  less in debt and have more assets at their disposal, which  would enable them to take fuller advantage of the opportunities the country’s economic and political transformations  are offering. 
Research indicates that vulnerability of SIM households and  villages has less to do with government services than it does  with their own characteristics.

Moreover, gender-sensitive research should recognize  that within the categories of men and women, girls and  boys there can be a great variety of perspectives based on  factors such as ethnicity, class, occupation, etc.
Women have statistically significantly higher levels of trust than men in the state/region government, political parties, the civil  service, the military, the police, the W/VTA, and education professionals. 
Although large numbers of women attend ward, village tract and village level meetings, they  are less likely than men attendees to participate actively in discussions. 
A strong participatory approach is essential for success.

The benefit that participation has on participants’ well-being depends heavily on the quality of participation – if participants have the  opportunity to actively contribute to discussions and genuinely influence decision-making then their participation is likely to be welfare enhancing, but if ‘participation’ simply entails attending meetings  with no opportunity to influence decisions this is much less likely to be the case.

SIM also paved the way for Qualitative  Social and Economic Monitoring which, in six rounds from 2012  to 2017, expanded understanding of village social and economic  life across Myanmar significantly (see World Bank. 2017, op. cit.). 
Education
Al though local legislatures are important pillars of a federal state, insufficient attention has been  paid to their current performance and the challenges they must overcome to strengthen as insti tutions. 
Most of the local leader interviewees that mentioned that participation in community life had  resulted in them having less time for family life or social life, having to work unsociable hours,  and/or a negative impact on their livelihood, spoke of their own feeling of concern or regret  over this.

Early rounds of SIM examined the social strength of villages  in the Delta following Nargis and, in later rounds, the evolv ing effects of assistance and aid delivery on social bonds.
In a small number of communities particularly badly affected  by Nargis, villagers reported that they were reluctant to  invest in improved housing, as a future storm would simply  destroy the houses.

Information is available in French and English.
Small farmers were  found to be the most affected by increased indebtedness,  followed by laborers who frequently had to borrow for con sumption and, therefore, were greatly affected by increases  in prices for food and other necessities.
Across SIM villages, farmers are taking steps (such as leav ing flood-prone land fallow, or attempting to build embank ments) in an effort to respond to the changing context for  their livelihoods, namely the progressively worsening cli mate issues (as reflected by increased flooding and more  pest problems).

The number of laws amended and replaced is also an important indicator of perfor mance; it reflects a hluttaw’s ability to respond to the needs and shortfalls of previously  passed laws. 
The  post-disaster relief and recovery aid had only limited specific support for women, though clearly a range of activities  benefited them as much as or more than men, for instance  in water and sanitation.

The increases have been driven by farmers’ use  of better quality and more expensive seed and fertilizer, as  well as much higher labor costs.  
As there is no longer  any officially designated role for the 100 household heads,  the VTA role has gradually taken over many of the duties  they previously had, such as issuing letters or bearing wit ness to agreements. 
The most common concern re spondents shared was the frequent trans fer of office staff from one place to another  within the GAD system. This resulted in  frequent turn-over and left local legisla tures with staff unfamiliar with hluttaw pro cedures and without the necessary political  knowledge for the position.

•  The destruction of spawning grounds and the pressure  on livelihoods, linked to a post-disaster aid emphasis on  providing fishing equipment within the first year after  Nargis, led to overfishing in many rivers and streams.

Case-2: During the discussion over the 2015-2016 Budget Bill, the government requested MMK 12,000,000 for  the construction of official guest houses in the government residential compound. Dr. Aung Naing Oo, argued  against the proposal saying that the large amount of money will benefit too few people and that it should in stead be used for local development projects that will benefit more people and communities. At the time of the  interview, respondents figured the possibility of the hluttaw adopting his advice was about 80%.  
However, women in Myanmar, and especially older  women, are more likely than men to have received little or no education45 – this can be a barrier  to them becoming leaders at local levels, and to actively participate in community meetings.

Myanmar’s first past the post electoral system means that a quota law requiring that all parties have a minimum percentage of candidates that are women may be ineffective – parties that are not strongly motivated to raise women’s participation could simply allocate many of  their women candidates to constituencies that they have little or no chance of winning. 
Thus, the role of a parliamentary research service is to provide neutral analysis covering a wide spectrum of perspectives on any  issue that would be the same whether it is offered to government or opposition members.

A worthwhile consideration before starting to draft and write a research brief is to think critically about your audience, as  this is fundamental to writing an effective briefing.
In conducting  the study, we found that most respondents thought that speakers coming from senior military  positions would be best able to form strong relationships with chief ministers and be in the more  strategic position to counterbalance the executive branch, given that the executive is composed  primarily of former senior military personnel. Respondents further expressed beliefs that only such  relationships between the executive and legislative involving former senior military personnel  would provide the necessary foundations for the local hluttaws to flourish as the second pillar of a  democratic checks-and-balance system.

Respondents from the studied hluttaws indicated that there has been less information  and discussion provided in the hluttaws regarding the affairs of those constituencies represented  by dually appointed MPs. This is largely because these MPs are unable to bring forward questions  and motions related to their constituencies because of irregular hluttaw attendance.

These changes have been driven by a range of factors that can be broadly categorized as labor action and  farming context.
Previous rounds of SIM research found that the quality of soil was an important determinant of what a farmer could expect his land to produce. In SIM 5, in large part due to more frequent flooding acroos the SIM panel, soil quality's importance has declined and the location of a farmer's land  (i.e., whether it is at a higher elevation away from major rivers) is now the most important  determinant of yield.

Therefore, improving the gender equality of participation in governance bodies should typically result  in policy-making decisions becoming more equitable, as these governance bodies become less biased  towards to the needs and preferences of male citizens.
