Contrary to Mon State and Sagaing Region, the study found that weak leadership in  Yangon Region Hluttaw and Shan State Hluttaw constrained the efforts of active members,  particularly with regards to their legislative oversight initiatives.

Constituencies where MPs were dually appointed to executive positions are underrep resented. 
In practice,  however, office heads are also accountable to the speaker of the respective hluttaw, while they  fondly expressed GAD as their mother department.

Oversight initiatives made through motions and questions, regular functions of all stud ied local legislatures, are accessible oversight performance options since they do not require  extensive legal knowledge.

In contrary, when the bill was discussed directly in the  hluttaw, one or two candidates would express support for the bill and request the hluttaw’s approval.

Local legislatures (state and region hluttaws) are required as part of their routine  legislative activities to review and pass these routine laws.  
Consequently, the Mon State Land  Tax Law became a pending law, while the issue remained controversial among local legislative members. No other  legislative efforts for land tax laws appeared in any other state or region hluttaw.

Some MPs pointed out that such restrictions  on information are unconstitutional as per Chapter 4, Article 184, which permits state and region  activity records to be shared with the public.  
This report aims to inform policy makers, political actors, civil societies and international do nors, experts and academics on the performance of Myanmar’s state and region hluttaws, key  federal institutions, during their first term from 2010 to 2015 and to provide recommendations to  strengthen these institutions. This study further aims to provide baseline information on regional  hluttaw performance.

“The motion for the bill for the  evaluation on local development  projects was not even allowed to  be submitted as a motion as [the  speaker] thought that it would  make trouble for the region  government. The motion I submitted for preparing the municipal bill was rejected, and the same motion submitted by the mynicipal department was passed through, though it came later”
Importantly, respondents expressed that personal office  space in the hluttaws would improve public communication with constituencies. 
Recommendations 
Thus, this study  recommends the development of a strong independent tribunal with sufficient technical capacity  to provide necessary advice, feedback and decisions.  
While the overall performances of local legislatures can be measured by the above mentioned  these tangible indicators, the effectiveness of these legislatures can also be measured by several  intangible factors, including structural limitations, procedural constraints, limited institutional  capacity and personal attributes.  
The study reported that most leaders and MPs of studied hluttaws and CSOs recommend a  system where the chief minister of a state or a region is elected by its legislature as  opposed to the current system where the Union President appoints chief ministers.

While hluttaw journals have been regularly published in all studied hluttaws except for  Shan State Hluttaw and Yangon Region Hluttaw, the coverage of their distribution is primarily  limited to MPs and government ministries.

This was appreci ated by not only the MPs of the respective hluttaws but also local CSOs and the media. 
While some motions and questions successful ly became government pledges, implementation of some pledges was delayed due to unclear  authority between Schedule (A) and Schedule (B) of the 2008 Constitution. Limited coordination  between the Union and state and region departments also hindered the effective implementation  of government pledges.

Effectiveness of communication and public access to informa tion, including information distribution
In addition to these  committees, most hluttaws, except for Kayin State, Rakhine State and Yangon Region Hluttaws,  formed several other committees to regulate oversight functions. 
Speakers of those hluttaws with new  buildings expressed that they felt they had fulfilled an important duty during their term of office.
