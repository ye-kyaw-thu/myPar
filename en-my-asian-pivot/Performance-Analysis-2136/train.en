Most  respondents perceived that speakers from senior military backgrounds were most likely to be  able to form upper-hand relationships or be in a  good position to counterbalance the executive,  given that the executive is predominantly led by  former high profile military personnel. Respondents further expressed beliefs that only such  relationships between the executive and legis lative involving former senior military personnel  would provide the necessary foundations for  the local hluttaws to develop as the second pil lar of a democratic checks-and-balance system.

Articles 446 and 447 of the Constitution conflict with the legislative authority granted to  local legislatures in Article 188. 
Most respondents identified common factors that influence the effec tiveness of hluttaws. These factors include: 1) the perception that local legislatures are subordi nate to local executive authorities; 2) the ability for legislative members to take dual positions; and  3) the limited experience of legislative members. Although some of these issues were discussed in  the other sections of this report, they are discussed in detail in the following sections.  
Data collected during the study show  that 64%, 65%, 55%, and 32% of elected MPs in Kayin State, Mon State, Tanintharyi Region and  Rakhine State Hluttaws respectively accepted a dual role.

The number of laws amended and replaced is also an important indicator of performance  as it reflects a hluttaw’s ability to respond to the needs and shortfalls of previously passed  laws. 
The study team conducted interviews with the head staff of hluttaw offices and  analyzed feedback from hluttaw speakers and MPs regarding the effectiveness and limitations of  the offices.

In addition to reviewing and passing routine laws, there are several other important legislative  efforts that contribute to the effectiveness and performance of state and region hluttaws. 
2 In the Constitution of Myanmar (2008), Schedule One is “The Union Legislative List”, which means the breadth of the power grant ed to the central government, and the Schedule Two is “The Region or State Legislative List”, which is the residual prerogatives  granted to States and Regions (local) governments.
Despite these common perceptions, however,  the study found that the speakers of the Mon  State and Sagaing Region Hluttaws, both of civilian background, maintain a mutually respect ful relationship with the executive officials who  were previously senior military members. When  asked about the leadership characteristics that  best foster diplomatic relations, respondents stated that previous experience, educational background, and, most importantly, the individual will  for change are the key characteristics of a strong and successful leader. Such characteristics  helped leaders succeed in leading their hluttaws to a measurable level of success, even in the  challenging context of a democratic transition (Please see Annex C. for the occupational background of hluttaw speakers and chief ministers and the relationships between legislative and ex ecutive officials).

Some  active MPs and speakers suggested that clarity is needed in Schedule Two, while others suggest ed vesting residual power with the states and regions. 
“The legislative efforts are in vain  due to confusion [between  Schedule One and Two]. The bill  for Shwe Ti Gon Pagoda Trusteeship Law could not be  submitted as they said Shwe Ti  Gon’s image is Union-level  authority. Another effort for a bill  for the provision of allowance to  those teachers working in  remote areas of Yangon was  also treated as Union legislative  power.” 
Regarding Mon State Hluttaw, elected member U Aung Naing Oo from the All  Mon Region Democracy Party (AMRDP) received strong applause from his colleagues, including the  speaker, MPs from other political parties, and other stakeholders from CSOs and the media for his  legislative and oversight efforts (See Box 3 below for his detailed profile). 
Once motions were recorded as government pledg es, some hluttaws began monitoring how ministries or departments acted on these pledges. The  hluttaws used different monitoring procedures, resulting in varying methods, parameters and indi cators for accessing how pledges are implemented or fulfilled. The study found similar variances in  the methodology used to trace the recorded number of complaints and the number resolved  during the first five-year term.

In these four hluttaws, there was an even split between hluttaw  speakers of a civilian background and those of a military background. 
For the hluttaw  offices, this resulted in frequent turn-over and with the employment of several staff who lack the  necessary political knowledge to carry out the duties of the position.

Based on all key findings, the study concludes that three main factors contribute to the per formance and effectiveness of local legislatures. 
2014-2015 
Although it is not required for  laws to promulgate supporting rules and regulations, both local legislative and executive authori ties generally perceive such rules and regulations to be necessary.  
The Union of Myanmar National Gazette, issued weekly on the  official website of the Ministry of Information, is arguably the only channel for up-to-date govern ment information, such as approved laws, official declarations and contracts.

In the smaller states and regions where a significant number of elected MPs were appoint ed to cabinet positions as state or region ministers, notably Kayin State, Mon State and Tanin tharyi Region, the dual role issue is a larger problem.

The active legislative and oversight efforts of individual MPs in Mon Sate Hluttaw and Yan gon Region Hluttaw were considered outstanding cases that prove that strong individual ef forts can influence local legislatures and show how individuals can effectively resist influence from  executive officials.

Respondents from the studied hluttaws indicated that there has been less information  and discussion provided in the hluttaws regarding the affairs of those constituencies represented  by dually appointed MPs. This is largely because these MPs are unable to bring forward questions  and motions related to their constituencies because of irregular hluttaw attendance.  
The study recommends constitutional support that guarantees a  space to recognize and address the efforts of members of any political party, especially those from  political parties with underrepresented in the hluttaw.

It is important, ac cording to hluttaw leaders and MPs, that hluttaws be separate from the state government offices  in order to: 1) physically separate local administration and legislatures to create a visible separation  of their roles; 2) alleviate concerns regarding unwarranted influence from the executive, particular ly from chief ministers and GADs; and 3) provide for the practical space needs of all departments,  committees and MPs in residence during hluttaw sessions.

The study found that only a few of the non-routine laws, notably  municipal laws and fishery laws, submitted by the state and region ministries were drafted by the  relevant administrative departments. Hluttaw legislation committees drafted the remaining  non-routine laws and turned them over to the respective ministry for official submission as a bill in  the hluttaw.  
Many also perceived that since it was mostly chief ministers and state and  region ministers who take on dual roles, their executive role must be more important. 
The most common communication channel is direct engagement between MPs and the  public.

In Mon State Hluttaw and Sagaing Region Hluttaw, civilian speakers maintained mutu ally respected relationships with the chief ministers from high profile military backgrounds  and successfully led their hluttaws.

Case-2: During the discussion over the 2015-2016 Budget Bill, the government requested MMK 12,000,000 for  the construction of official guest houses in the government residential compound. Dr. Aung Naing Oo, argued  against the proposal saying that the large amount of money will benefit too few people and that it should in stead be used for local development projects that will benefit more people and communities. At the time of the  interview, respondents figured the possibility of the hluttaw adopting his advice was about 80%.  
Although it is not required for laws to promulgate supporting rules and regulations, both local legislative and executive  authorities generally perceive such rules and regulations to be necessary.  
The ability for members to accept dual roles in the legislative and executive was identified  by respondents as the most common structural issue.

The Asia Founda tion’s “State and Region Governments in Myanmar”4 suggests the same: “…perhaps better indica tion of political decentralization and legislative autonomy would be to exclude the two ‘routine’ actions required of all states and regions: passing the budget law and the development plan.”  
Of the remaining MPs who do not hold dual positions, only one remained  active. Another passed away and the active participation of the others are inhibited by old age  and poor health conditions.

As most MPs in studied hluttaws participated as respondents in the  study, the study recommends a thorough review of the policy that constitutionally allows local MPs  to accept dual roles.  
Among studied hluttaws,  only two local hluttaws, Mon State Hluttaw and  Ayeyarwaddy Region Hluttaw, have promulgated a  law for the industrial sector.6

The administrative support offices of local legislatures are sub-departments of the  General Administration Department (GAD), and the Ministry of Home Affairs appoints the  key office staff. 
These misperceptions need to be addressed to promote the role of local legislatures as institutions that are parallel  in importance to executive institutions. 
These  structures of governance are new institutions for Myanmar, an historically centralized country.

Case-2: The plan that came from the motion proposing the construction of a connecting road to the famous  Kyaik Teo (the Golden Rock) Pagoda from the express road, avoiding Kyaik Hto town and thus improving  traffic flow, has not yet been implemented as the concerned state department was still waiting for a reply  from the respective Union ministry.  
Table 11 shows the number of motions and questions recorded as government pledges.10 
Institution building and individual  capacity building
