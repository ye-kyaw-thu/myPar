Respondents stated that there has  been limited discussion on those constitu encies represented by MPs in dual positions  as those MPs are unable to bring forward  questions and motions related to their con stituencies in hluttaw.  
Mutually respected relationship;  State hluttaw was in a position to  check and balance the executive
The study found that the speakers of the Mon State, Tanintharyi Region, Sagaing Region, and  Ayeyarwaddy Region Hluttaws maintained mutually respectful relationships with the chief ministers.

Motions and questions were officially recorded as government  pledges when the concerned ministers or department heads gave hluttaws their official promise  to act on the particular motion or question. 
The speakers of the Mon  State Hluttaw and Sagaing Region Hluttaw are civilian while those of the Tanintharyi Region Hluttaw and Ayeyarwaddy Region Hluttaw are former military personnel.

The study found that only a few non-routine  laws submitted by state and region ministries,  notably municipal laws and fishery laws, were  drafted by the relevant departments. There maining non-routine laws were drafted by hlut taw legislation committees and turned over to  the respective ministry to be officially submitted  as a bill in the respective hluttaw.

Thus, the main purpose of  this study was to conduct a more comprehensive evaluation of the local legislatures in order to  recommend reliable evaluation mechanisms to help strengthen all local legislatures in Myanmar.  
Some hluttaws,  Mon State Hluttaw in particular, have active monitoring teams that performed regular reviews and  ground assessments on the implementation and fulfillment of pledges.

Among studied hluttaws, Sagaing Region, Mandalay Region and Kachin State Hluttaws passed  the most non-routine laws with 30, 29 and 27, or 62.5%, 64.4% and 63% of their individual total  legislative outputs, respectively (see Table 5 and Figure 3 below). 
According to the data  collected, the majority of government pledges were successfully implemented (See Table 12).

The budgets of the studied hluttaws do not include practical costs for important activ ities, notably field observation for oversight activities, documentation and publication, in formation sharing and distribution, and capacity building. 
Committees are an important avenue through which local legislatures exercise  oversight practices. The study found that hluttaws typically had three committees: The Legislation  Committee, the Representative Vetting Committee, and the Ethnic Affairs Committee.

Based on this research, many individual members had limited interest in and opportu nities to study and question the yearly audit report during official hluttaw discussions.  Respondents from the studied hluttaws said that the audit report was shared only on the day of,  or one day prior to, the presentation in the hluttaw. 
Individual performance assess ments should also be included in this mechanism.

These hluttaw leaders and  MPs believe that the capacity, role and authority of local legislatures has been diluted by allowing  MPs to simultaneously hold executive and legislative positions. 
Special 
Personal attributes or leadership skills
Respondents  feel that such a system is an important contribution to a clear checks-and-balance system.  
For instance, 41 elected MPs in  Shan State Hluttaw and 5 in Kayin State  Hluttaw, almost half of the total elected MPs  in those hluttaws, have never submitted  motions or questions throughout their five year term. 
The most common factors identified by respondents that influence the  effectiveness and functionality of the hluttaws are: the majority’s perception that the role and rank  of local legislatures is subordinate to local executive authorities, the ability for legislative members  to take dual positions in the cabinet and the limited political experience of legislative members.
